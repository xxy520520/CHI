"Development processes and practices in a small but growing software industry: a practitioner survey in New Zealand","Di Wang; Matthias Galster","Lentune Software Solutions, Christchurch, New Zealand; University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand","ESEM '18: Proceedings of the 12th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement","","2018","","","1","10","Background: Development processes and practices depend on the context in which software is developed (e.g., locations, organizations, projects, developers). Aim: We aim at understanding development processes and practices in New Zealand, a country with a relatively small but growing software sector. We are particularly interested in methods and practices used in such environment, the implementation technologies software development professionals use, how professionals ensure software quality, and how they manage software release processes. Method: We conducted a descriptive survey targeting individual software development professionals working in New Zealand software companies. Results: New Zealand professionals use similar methodologies as professionals in other countries. Popular programming languages differ somewhat to popular languages in other rankings. Quality assurance is rather ad-hoc and the release process is inspired by agile software development principles. Conclusions: Our findings highlight some differences of the New Zealand software industry to other countries. Furthermore, we identified some strengths and weaknesses related to processes and practices. Our findings can help software professionals and organizations reflect on (and potentially adjust) the way they work.","","","10.1145/3239235.3268926","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3239235.3268926","","Software notations and tools","","","","1","120","","","","","",""
"An empirical study of process policies and metrics to manage productivity and quality for maintenance of critical software systems at the jet propulsion laboratory","Dan Port; Bill Taber","University of Hawaii; California Institute of Technology","ESEM '18: Proceedings of the 12th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement","","2018","","","1","10","Context/ Background: The Mission Design and Navigation Software (MDN) Group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) develops and continuously maintains software systems critical for NASA deep space missions. Given limited budgets, staffing resources, and a time critical need for repair or enhancement, there is an ever-present temptation to sacrifice quality for higher productivity or slip release target to ensure better quality. We have learned that poor management of this increases risk of mission failure. As a result, our process must be both highly productive and maintain high quality (e.g. reliability, maintainability, usability). Inspired by the quality is free paradigm, we have instituted a set of Rapid Release maintenance process policies and measures aimed to continually manage productivity and quality. Six Rapid Release polices were established from well-known engineering principles and best practices to address specific issues of concern encountered in the development phase. However, due to the critically of our systems, we must have objective assurance that our developers are following the six policies and that they are demonstratively effective in addressing the areas of concern.","","","10.1145/3239235.3268925","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3239235.3268925","","Process validation","","","","0","112","","","","","",""

Several studies have measured the reliability of web applications in use against unhandled exceptions, showing a recurrence of the problem during the maintenance phase. Detecting latent unhandled exceptions automatically is difficult and application-specific. Hence, general approaches to deal with defects in web applications do not treat unhandled exceptions appropriately. Aims: To design and evaluate a method that can support finding, correcting, and preventing unhandled exceptions in web applications. Method: We applied the design science engineering cycle to design a method called Pattern-Driven Maintenance (PDM). PDM relies on identifying defect patterns based on application server logs and producing static analysis rules that can be used for prevention. We applied PDM to two industrial web applications involving different companies and technologies, measuring the reliability improvement and the precision of the produced static analysis rules. Results: In both cases, our approach allowed identifying defect patterns and finding latent unhandled exceptions to be fixed in the source code, enabling to completely eliminate the pattern-related failures and improving the application reliability. The static analysis rules produced by PDM achieved a precision of 59-68% in the first application and 89-100% in the second, where lessons learnt from the first evaluation were addressed. Conclusions: The results strengthen our confidence that PDM can help maintainers to improve the reliability for unhandled exceptions in other existing web applications.","","","10.1145/3239235.3268924","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3239235.3268924","","Maintaining software","","","","0","105","","","","","",""

Over the last several decades, computer games started to have a significant impact on society. However, although a computer game is a type of software, the process to conceptualize, produce and deliver a game could involve unusual features. In software testing, for instance, studies demonstrated the hesitance of professionals to use automated testing techniques with games, due to the constant changes in requirements and design, and pointed out the need for creating testing tools that take into account the flexibility required for the game development process. Goal. This study aims to improve the current body of knowledge regarding these theme and point out the existing particularities observed in software testing considering the development of a computer game. Method. A mixed-method approach based on a case study and a survey was applied to collect quantitative and qualitative data from practitioners regarding the particularities of software testing in game development. Results. We analyzed over 70 messages posted on three well-established network of question-and-answer communities and received answers of 38 practitioners, and identified important aspects to be observed in the process of planning, performing and reporting tests games. Conclusion. Considering computer games, software testing must focus not only on the common aspects of a general software, but also, track and investigate issues that could be related to game balance, game physics and entertainment related-aspects to guarantee the quality of computer games and a successful testing process.","","","10.1145/3239235.3268923","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3239235.3268923","","Software verification and validation","","","","1","130","","","","","",""

Consequently, test results (and how they are reported and visualized) may substantially influence business decisions in software-intensive organizations. Aims: This case study examines the role of test results from automated nightly software testing and the visualizations for decision making they enable at an embedded systems company in Sweden. In particular, we want to identify the use of the visualizations for supporting decisions from three aspects: in daily work, at feature branch merge, and at release time. Method: We conducted an embedded case study with multiple units of analysis by conducting interviews, questionnaires, using archival data and participant observations. Results: Several visualizations and reports built on top of the test results database are utilized in supporting daily work, merging a feature branch to the master and at release time. Some important visualizations are: lists of failing test cases, easy access to log files, and heatmap trend plots. The industrial practitioners perceived the visualizations and reporting as valuable, however they also mentioned several areas of improvement such as better ways of visualizing test coverage in a functional area as well as better navigation between different views. Conclusions: We conclude that visualizations of test results are a vital decision making tool for a variety of roles and tasks in embedded software development, however the visualizations need to be continuously improved to keep their value for its stakeholders.","","","10.1145/3239235.3268921","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3239235.3268921","","Software testing and debugging","","","","0","233","","","","","",""

Several TD management strategies have been proposed, but considering actions that could explicitly prevent the insertion of TD in the first place and monitor its effects is not yet a common practice. Thus, while TD management is an important topic, it is also worthwhile to understand the causes that could lead development teams to incur different types of debt as well as the effects of their presence on software projects. Aims: The objective of this work is twofold. First, we investigate the state of practice in the TD area including the status quo, the causes that lead to TD occurrence, and the effects of existing TD. Second, we present the design of InsighTD, a globally distributed family of industrial surveys on causes and effects of TD, and the results of its first execution. Method: We designed the InsighTD in joint collaboration with several TD researchers. It is designed to run as an incremental large scale study based on continuous and independent replications of the questionnaire in different countries. Results: This paper presents the first results of the first execution of the survey. In total, 107 practitioners from the Brazilian software industry answered the questionnaire. Results indicate that there is a broad familiarity with the concept of TD. Deadlines, inappropriate planning, lack of knowledge, and lack of a well-defined process are among the top 10 cited and most likely causes that lead to the occurrence of TD. On the other side, low quality, delivery delay, low maintainability, rework and financial loss are among the top 10 most commonly cited and impactful effects of TD. Conclusion: With InsighTD, we intend to reduce the problem of isolated investigations in TD that are not yet representative and, thus, build a continuous and generalizable empirical basis for understanding practical problems and challenges of TD.","","","10.1145/3239235.3268917","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3239235.3268917","","Software and its engineering","","","","8","221","","","","","",""

Relatively little is published on the RE competencies and skills industry expects, and seldom investigated the application domains calling for RE professionals. [Aims] We felt motivated by those findings to carry out research on RE job posts in a North-American market. Especially, we focused solely on RE-specific tasks, competencies and skills, from the perspective of defined position categories. Plus, we intend to explore the application domains in need for RE professionals to reveal the wide range of RE roles in industry. [Methods] Coding process, analysis, and synthesis were applied to the textual descriptions of the 190 RE job ads from Canada's most popular online job search site, especially to the text referring to tasks and competencies. [Results] We contribute to the empirical analysis of RE jobs, by providing insights from Canada's IT market in 2017. Using 109 RE job ads from the most popular IT job search portal T-Net, we identified the qualifications, experience and skills demanded by Canadian employers. Furthermore, we explored the distribution of those RE tasks and competences over the 11 categories of RE roles. [Conclusions] Our results suggest that the majority of the employers were big to very big companies in 29 business domains, and the most in-demand RE skills for them were related to RE methods and to project management aspects affecting requirements. In addition, employers placed much more emphasis on experience - both RE-specific and broad software engineering experience, than on higher education.","","","10.1145/3239235.3268916","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3239235.3268916","","Requirements analysis","","","","2","111","","","","","",""

We improve the original SZZ by proposing a way to link the code additions in a fixing change to a list of candidate inducing changes. Method. The improved version, A-SZZ, finds the code block encapsulating the new code added in a fixing change, and traces back to the historical changes of the code block. We mined the GitHub repositories of two projects, Angular.js and Vue, and ran A-SZZ to identify bug-inducing changes of code additions. We evaluated the effectiveness of A-SZZ in terms of inducing and fixing ratios, and time span between the two changes. Results. The approach works well for linking code additions with previous changes, although it still produces many false positives. Conclusions. Nearly a quarter of the files in fixing changes contain code additions only, and hence, new heuristics should be implemented to link those with inducing changes in a more efficient way.","","","10.1145/3239235.3267440","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3239235.3267440","","Software defect analysis","","","","3","134","","","","","",""

The process is usually complex, iterated and time-consuming. Commonly, researchers seldom start building the machine model from scratch. They may select some well-known and well-trained models in similar task domains as the reference models. Then they try to tune the hyper-parameters and accelerate the iteration. Thus, some models are often reused and need to be reproduced by using new training dataset. Moreover, understanding the model and the iteration is more necessary. This scenario is very similar to that of software reuse. In this poster, we propose Modelware and argue the need of Modelware to make the machine learning model reusable and reproducible. We define the Modelware which is the reused object and develop a model repository to provide the model lineage management and model visit tool. The big data for building model is managed collaboratively so that the model can be reproduced. The iteration process to obtain the final optimized model is abstracted and implemented using a lightweight workflow.

Aim: We propose a method that relies on replicated LDA runs, clustering, and providing a stability metric for the topics. Method: We generate k LDA topics and replicate this process n times resulting in n*k topics. Then we use K-medioids to cluster the n*k topics to k clusters. The k clusters now represent the original LDA topics and we present them like normal LDA topics showing the ten most probable words. For the clusters, we try multiple stability metrics, out of which we recommend Rank-Biased Overlap, showing the stability of the topics inside the clusters. Results: We provide an initial validation where our method is used for 270,000 Mozilla Firefox commit messages with k=20 and n=20.

However, emoticons provide information about developer sentiments that can easily be extracted from software repositories. Aim: We investigate how software developers use emoticons differently in issue trackers in order to better understand the differences between developers and determine to which extent emoticons can be used as in place of sentiment analysis. Method: We extract emoticons from 1.3M comments from Apache's issue tracker and 4.5M from Mozilla's issue tracker using regular expressions built from a list of emoticons used by SentiStrength and Wikipedia. We check for statistical differences using Mann-Whitney U tests and determine the effect size with Cliff's δ. Results: Overall Mozilla developers rely more on emoticons than Apache developers. While the overall rate of comments with emoticons is of 1% and 3% for Apache and Mozilla, some individual developers can have a rate up to 21%. Looking specifically at Mozilla developers, we find that western developers use significantly more emoticons (with medium size effect) than eastern developers. While the majority of emoticons are used to express joy, we find that Mozilla developers use emoticons more frequently to express sadness and surprise than Apache developers. Finally, we find that Apache developers use overall more emoticons during weekends than during weekdays, with the share of sad and surprised emoticons increasing during weekends. Conclusions: While emoticons are primarily used to express joy, the more occasional use of sad and surprised emoticons can potentially be utilized to detect frustration in place of sentiment analysis among developers using emoticons frequently enough.","","","10.1145/3239235.3267434","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3239235.3267434","","Sentiment analysis","","","","1","97","","","","","",""

Aims: In this case study we investigated an offshore vendor company and in particular whether the employees' retention is related with their experience. Moreover, we studied whether we can identify a threshold associated with the employees' tendency to leave the particular company. Method: We used a case study, applied and presented descriptive statistics, contingency tables, results from Chi-Square test of association and post hoc tests. Results: The emerging results showed that employee retention and company experience are associated. In particular, almost 90% of the employees are leaving the company within the first year, where the percentage within the second year is 50-50%. Thus, there is an indication that the 2 years' time is the retention threshold for the investigated offshore vendor company. Conclusions: The results are preliminary and lead us to the need for building a prediction model which should include more inherent characteristics of the projects to aid the companies avoiding massive turnover waves.","","","10.1145/3239235.3267431","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3239235.3267431","","Software management","","","","2","136","","","","","",""

It is essential for hardware startups, companies that involve both software and hardware development, to be not only agile to develop their business but also efficient to develop the right products. [Objective] We investigate how hardware startups achieve agility when developing their products in early stages. [Methods] A qualitative research is conducted with data from 20 hardware startups. [Result] Preliminary results show that agile development is known to hardware entrepreneurs, however it is limitedly adopted. We also found four categories of tactics: (1) strategy, (2) personnel, (3) artifact and (4) resource that enable hardware startups agile in their early stage business and product development.

They typically use third-party software libraries and are deployed on generic hardware, which suffer from delay faults that can cause serious damage. To improve availability and latency, the controllers in RTCSs are replicated on physical nodes. As physical replication is expensive, we study the alternative of exploiting virtualization technology to run multiple virtual replicas on the same physical node. As virtual replicas share the same resources, the delay faults they experience might be correlated, which would make such a replication method unsuitable. We conduct several experiments with an RTCS for electric grids, with multiple virtual replicas of its controller. We find that although the delay of a virtual machine is higher than of a physical machine, the correlation between high delays among the virtual replicas is insignificant, causing an overall improved availability. We conclude that virtual replication is indeed applicable to certain RTCSs, as it can improve reliability without added cost.","","","10.1145/3239235.3267429","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3239235.3267429","","Real-time systems software","","","","0","125","","","","","",""

However, only a few studies reported results of leveraging app changelogs together with app reviews. [Aims] Motivated by those findings, this exploratory experimental study looks into the role of app changelogs in the classification of requirements derived from app reviews. We aim at understanding if the use of app changelogs can lead to more accurate identification and classification of functional and non-functional requirements from app reviews. We also want to know which classification technique works better in this context. [Method] We did a case study on the effect of app changelogs on automatic classification of app reviews. Specifically, manual labeling, text preprocessing, and four supervised machine learning algorithms were applied to a series of experiments, varying in the number of app changelogs in the experimental data. [Results] We compared the accuracy of requirements classification from app reviews, by training the four classifiers with varying combinations of app reviews and changelogs. Among the four algorithms, Naïve Bayes was found to be more accurate for categorizing app reviews. [Conclusions] The results show that official app changelogs did not contribute to more accurate identification and classification of requirements from app reviews. In addition, Naïve Bayes seems to be more suitable for our further research on this topic.","","","10.1145/3239235.3267428","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3239235.3267428","","Requirements analysis","","","","0","156","","","","","",""

Several studies have investigated challenges in aligning security practices with agile methods, however, none of these have examined security challenges in the context of large-scale agile. Large-scale agile can present unique challenges, as large organizations often involve highly interdependent teams that need to align with other (non-agile) departments. Goal Our objective is to identify security challenges encountered in large-scale agile software development from the perspective of agile practitioners. Method Cooperative Method Development is applied to guide a qualitative case study at Rabobank, a Dutch multinational banking organization. A total of ten interviews is conducted with members in different agile roles from five different agile development teams. Data saturation has been obtained. By open card sorting we identify challenges pertaining to security in agile. Results The following challenges appear to be unique to large-scale agile: alignment of security objectives in a distributed setting, developing a common understanding of the roles and responsibilities in security activities, and integration of low-overhead security testing tools. Additional challenges reported appear to be common to security in software development in general or concur with challenges reported for small-scale agile. Conclusions The reported findings suggest the presence of multiple security challenges unique to large-scale agile. Future work should focus on confirming these challenges and investigating possible mitigations.","","","10.1145/3239235.3267426","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3239235.3267426","","Agile software development","","","","2","206","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, it is seldom applied in practice because it is computationally expensive. We witnessed 48 hours of mutation testing time on a test suite comprising 272 unit tests and 5,258 lines of test code for testing a project with 48,873 lines of production code. Aims: Therefore, researchers are currently investigating cloud solutions, hoping to achieve sufficient speed-up to allow for a complete mutation test run during the nightly build. Method: In this paper we evaluate mutation testing in the cloud against two industrial projects. Results: With our proof-of-concept, we achieved a speed-up between 12x and 12.7x on a cloud infrastructure with 16 nodes. This allowed to reduce the aforementioned 48 hours of mutation testing time to 3.7 hours. Conclusions: We make a detailed analysis of the delays induced by the distributed architecture, point out avenues for further optimisation and elaborate on the lessons learned for the mutation testing community. Most importantly, we learned that for optimal deployment in a cloud infrastructure, tasks should remain completely independent. Mutant optimisation techniques that violate this principle will benefit less from deploying in the cloud.","","","10.1145/3239235.3240506","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3239235.3240506","","Software performance","","","","0","85","","","","","",""

This means that code is natural and this naturalness can be captured by natural language modelling techniques. Such models promise to capture the program semantics and identify source code parts that `smell', i.e., they are strange, badly written and are generally error-prone (likely to be defective). Aims: We investigate the use of natural language modelling techniques in mutation testing (a testing technique that uses artificial faults). We thus, seek to identify how well artificial faults simulate real ones and ultimately understand how natural the artificial faults can be. Our intuition is that natural mutants, i.e., mutants that are predictable (follow the implicit coding norms of developers), are semantically useful and generally valuable (to testers). We also expect that mutants located on unnatural code locations (which are generally linked with error-proneness) to be of higher value than those located on natural code locations. Method: Based on this idea, we propose mutant selection strategies that rank mutants according to a) their naturalness (naturalness of the mutated code), b) the naturalness of their locations (naturalness of the original program statements) and c) their impact on the naturalness of the code that they apply to (naturalness differences between original and mutated statements). We empirically evaluate these issues on a benchmark set of 5 open-source projects, involving more than 100k mutants and 230 real faults. Based on the fault set we estimate the utility (i.e. capability to reveal faults) of mutants selected on the basis of their naturalness, and compare it against the utility of randomly selected mutants. Results: Our analysis shows that there is no link between naturalness and the fault revelation utility of mutants. We also demonstrate that the naturalness-based mutant selection performs similar (slightly worse) to the random mutant selection. Conclusions: Our findings are negative but we consider them interesting as they confute a strong intuition, i.e., fault revelation is independent of the mutants' naturalness.","","","10.1145/3239235.3240500","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3239235.3240500","","Software testing and debugging","","","","1","154","","","","","",""

TSR approaches can be classified as adequate or inadequate.

Results: We found that code review and unit testing are the two most effective software development practices among BCS developers. The results suggest that the requirements of BCS projects are mostly identified and selected by community discussion and project owners which is different from requirement collection of general OSS projects. The results also reveal that the development tasks in BCS projects are primarily assigned on voluntary basis, which is the usual task assignment practice for OSS projects.

In memorization task tabular and graphical notations showed equivalent results, but it is statistically significant only between two graphical notations. [Conclusion] Three notations provide similar support to decision-makers when they need to extract and remember correct information about security risks.","","","10.1145/3239235.3239247","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3239235.3239247","","Risk management","","","","1","84","","","","","",""

Aims: The goal of our research is to identify maintenance communities and monitor their evolution-birth, growth, death and rejuvenation. Method: In this paper, we leveraged a social community detection algorithm---clique prelocation method (CPM)---to identify file communities. Then we implemented an algorithm to detect new communities, active communities, inactive communities and reactivated communities by cumulatively detecting and constantly comparing communities in time sequences. Results: Based on our analysis of 14 open-source projects, we found that new communities are mostly caused by bug and improvement issues. An active community can be vigorous, on and off, through the entire life of a system, and so does an inactive community. In addition, an inactive community can be reactivated again, mostly through bug issues. Conclusions: These findings add to our understanding of software maintenance communities and help us identify the most expensive maintenance spots by identifying constantly active communities.","","","10.1145/3239235.3239246","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3239235.3239246","","Software evolution","","","","1","128","","","","","",""

In psychology it has been used to study the relationships between work well-being and productivity. To our best knowledge, daily experience sampling has not been previously used in software engineering. Aims: Our aim is to identify links between software developers self-reported affective states and work well-being and measures obtained from software repositories. Method: We perform an experience sampling study in a software company for a period of eight months, we use logistic regression to link the well-being measures with development activities, i.e. number of commits and chat messages. Results: We find several significant relationships between questionnaire variables and software repository variables. To our surprise relationship between hurry and number of commits is negative, meaning more perceived hurry is linked with a smaller number of commits. We also find a negative relationship between social interaction and hindered work well-being. Conclusions: The negative link between commits and hurry is counter-intuitive and goes against previous lab-experiments in software engineering that show increased efficiency under time pressure. Overall, our is an initial step in using experience sampling in software engineering and validating theories on work well-being from other fields in the domain of software engineering.","","","10.1145/3239235.3239245","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3239235.3239245","","Programming teams","","","","3","110","","","","","",""

However, no published studies from real cases exist that indicate what an optimal WIP limit should be. Aims: The primary aim is to study the effect of WIP on the performance of a Kanban team. The secondary aim is to illustrate methodological challenges when attempting to identify an optimal or appropriate WIP limit. Method: A quantitative case study was conducted in a software company that provided information about more than 8,000 work items developed over four years by five teams. Relationships between WIP, lead time and productivity were analyzed. Results: WIP correlates with lead time; that is, lower WIP indicates shorter lead times, which is consistent with claims in the literature. However, WIP also correlates with productivity, which is inconsistent with the claim in the literature that a low WIP (still above a certain threshold) will improve productivity. The collected data set did not include sufficient information to measure aspects of quality. There are several threats to the way productivity was measured. Conclusions: Indicating an optimal WIP limit is difficult in the studied company because a changing WIP gives contrasting results on different team performance variables. Because the effect of WIP has not been quantitatively examined before, this study clearly needs to be replicated in other contexts. In addition, studies that include other team performance variables, such as various aspects of quality, are requested. The methodological challenges illustrated in this paper need to be addressed.","","","10.1145/3239235.3239238","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3239235.3239238","","Software development process management","","","","0","198","","","","","",""

This approach is not suitable for compilation and using program analysis techniques that require byte-code. At the same time, compiling the whole software not only is costly but may also leave us with many uncompilable and unanalyzed revisions. Aims: We intend to demonstrate if analyzing changes in a module results in achieving a high compilation ratio and a better understanding of software quality evolution. Method: We conduct a large-scale multi-perspective empirical study on 37838 distinct revisions of the core module of 68 systems across Apache, Google, and Netflix to assess their compilability and identify when the software is uncompilable as a result of a developer's fault. We study the characteristics of uncompilable revisions and analyze compilable ones to understand the impact of developers on software quality. Results: We achieve high compilation ratios: 98.4% for Apache, 99.0% for Google, and 94.3% for Netflix. We identify 303 sequences of uncompile commits and create a model to predict uncompilability based on commit metadata with an F1-score of 0.89 and an AUC of 0.96. We identify statistical differences between the impact of affiliated and external developers of organizations. Conclusions: Focusing on a module results in a more complete and accurate software evolution analysis, reduces the cost and complexity, and facilitates manual inspection.","","","10.1145/3239235.3239237","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3239235.3239237","","Software configuration management and version control systems","","","","1","221","","","","","",""

A recent study by Yang et al. at FSE'16 leveraged individual change metrics to build unsupervised JIT defect prediction model. They found that many unsupervised models performed similarly to or better than the state-of-the-art supervised models in effort-aware JIT defect prediction. Goal: In Yang et al.'s study, code churn (i.e. the change size of a code change) was neglected when building unsupervised defect prediction models. In this study, we aim to investigate the effectiveness of code churn based unsupervised defect prediction model in effort-aware JIT defect prediction. Methods: Consistent with Yang et al.'s work, we first use code churn to build a code churn based unsupervised model (CCUM). Then, we evaluate the prediction performance of CCUM against the state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised models under the following three prediction settings: cross-validation, time-wise cross-validation, and cross-project prediction. Results: In our experiment, we compare CCUM against the state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised JIT defect prediction models. Based on six open-source projects, our experimental results show that CCUM performs better than all the prior supervised and unsupervised models. Conclusions: The result suggests that future JIT defect prediction studies should use CCUM as a baseline model for comparison when a novel model is proposed.","","","10.1109/ESEM.2017.8","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ESEM.2017.8","","Risk management","","","","2","104","","","","","",""

Core contributors and peripheral contributors work together to create a successful project, each playing a different role. One-Time Contributors (OTCs), who are on the very fringe of the peripheral developers, are largely unstudied despite offering unique insights into the development process. In a prior survey, we identified OTCs and discovered their motivations and barriers. Aims: The objective of this study is to corroborate the survey results and provide a better understand of OTCs. We compare OTCs to other peripheral and core contributors to determine whether they are distinct. Method: We mined data from the same code-review repository used to identify survey respondents in our previous study. After identifying each contributor as core, periphery, or OTC, we compared them in terms of patch size, time interval from submission to decision, the nature of their conversations, and patch acceptance rates. Results: We identified a continuum between core developers and OTCs. OTCs create smaller patches, face longer time intervals between patch submission and rejection, have longer review conversations, and face lower patch acceptance rates. Conversely, core contributors create larger patches, face shorter time intervals for feedback, have shorter review conversations, and have patches accepted at the highest rate. The peripheral developers fall in between the OTCs and the core contributors. Conclusion: OTCs do, in fact, face the barriers identified in our prior survey. They represent a distinct group of contributors compared to core and peripheral developers.","","","10.1109/ESEM.2017.7","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ESEM.2017.7","","","","","","8","64","","","","","",""

We found that the job titles used in industry for the specialists that the RE community calls `requirements engineers', are `Product Owner' and `Analyst', be it Information Analyst, Application Analyst, or Data Analyst. Those professionals supposed to perform RE tasks also take responsibility for additional tasks including quality assurance, realization and deployment, and project management. The most in-demand skills are soft skills: proficiency in Dutch and English, plus communication and analytical skills. RE is perceived as an occupation for experts, with 23% of all job ads asking explicitly for RE experience and 63% asking for experience similar to RE.","","","10.1109/ESEM.2017.60","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ESEM.2017.60","","","","","","2","71","","","","","",""
"On software productivity analysis with propensity score matching","Masateru Tsunoda; Sousuke Amasaki","Kindai University, Higashiosaka, Japan; Okayama Prefectural University, Soja, Japan","ESEM '17: Proceedings of the 11th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement","","2017","","","436","441","[Context:] Software productivity analysis is an essential activity for software process improvement. It specifies critical factors to be resolved or accepted from project data. As the nature of project data is observational, not experimental, the project data involves bias that can cause spurious relationships among analyzed factors. Analysis methods based on linear regression suffer from the spurious relationships and sometimes lead an inappropriate causal relation. The propensity score is a solution for this problem but has rarely been used. [Objective:] To investigate what differences the use of propensity score brings to software productivity analysis in comparison to a conventional method. [Method:] We revisited classical software productivity analyses on ISBSG and Finnish datasets. The differences of critical factors between the propensity score and the linear regression were investigated. [Results:] Both analysis methods specified different critical factors on the two datasets. The specified factors were both reasonable to some extent, and further considerations are needed for the propensity score results. [Conclusions:] The use of propensity score can lead new possible factors to be tackled. Although the contradiction does not necessarily indicate a flaw of the linear regression, the results by the propensity score should also be noticed for better actions.","","","10.1109/ESEM.2017.59","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ESEM.2017.59","","","","","","1","27","","","","","",""

A long-term practice in software industry is to hire professional translators or translation companies to perform the translation. However, due to the large number of user-interface labels and target languages, this is often too expensive for software providers, especially cost-sensitive providers such as personal developers of mobile apps. As natural language processing and machine techniques advance, more mature machine translation techniques are providing a cheap though imperfect alternative, and the Google Translation service has already been widely used for translating websites and apps. However, the effect of lower translation quality on user experience has not been well studied yet. In this paper, we present a user study on 6 popular Android apps, which involves 24 participants performing tasks on app variants with 4 different translation quality levels and 2 target languages: Spanish and Chinese. From our study, we acquire the following 3 major findings, including (1) compared with original versions, machine translated versions of apps have similar task completion rate and efficiency on most studied apps; (2) machine translated versions have more tasks completed with flaws such unnecessary steps and missed optional steps, and (3) users are not satisfied with the GUI of machine translated versions and the two major complaints are misleading labels of input boxes, and unclear translation of items in option lists.","","","10.1109/ESEM.2017.58","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ESEM.2017.58","","","","","","0","39","","","","","",""

Considering the comments written by developers often describe the intent behind the code change, we propose a method to automatically generate commit comment by reusing the existing comments in version control system. Specifically, for an input commit, we apply syntax, semantic, pre-syntax, and pre-semantic similarities to discover the similar commits from half a million commits, and recommend the reusable comments to the input commit from the ones of the similar commits. We evaluate our approach on 7 projects. The results show that 9.1% of the generated comments are good, 27.7% of the generated comments need minor fix, and 63.2% are bad, and we also analyze the reasons that make a comment available or unavailable.","","","10.1109/ESEM.2017.56","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ESEM.2017.56","","","","","","4","93","","","","","",""

Maia","Federal University of Uberkândia, Brazil; Federal University of Uberlândia, Brazil","ESEM '17: Proceedings of the 11th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement","","2017","","","404","413","[Background]: There are more bugs in real-world programs than human programmers can realistically address. Several approaches have been proposed to aid debugging. A recent research direction that has been increasingly gaining interest to address the reduction of costs associated with defect repair is automatic program repair. Recent work has shown that some kind of bugs are more suitable for automatic repair techniques. [Aim]: The detection and characterization of common bug-fix patterns in software repositories play an important role in advancing the field of automatic program repair. In this paper, we aim to characterize the occurrence of known bug-fix patterns in Java repositories at an unprecedented large scale. [Method]: The study was conducted for Java GitHub projects organized in two distinct data sets: the first one (i.e., Boa data set) contains more than 4 million bug-fix commits from 101,471 projects and the second one (i.e., Defects4J data set) contains 369 real bug fixes from five open-source projects. We used a domain-specific programming language called Boa in the first data set and conducted a manual analysis on the second data set in order to confront the results. [Results]: We characterized the prevalence of the five most common bug-fix patterns (identified in the work of Pan et al.) in those bug fixes. The combined results showed direct evidence that developers often forget to add IF preconditions in the code. Moreover, 76% of bug-fix commits associated with the IF-APC bug-fix pattern are isolated from the other four bug-fix patterns analyzed. [Conclusion]: Targeting on bugs that miss preconditions is a feasible alternative in automatic repair techniques that would produce a relevant payback.","","","10.1109/ESEM.2017.55","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ESEM.2017.55","","Software testing and debugging","","","","1","89","","","","","",""

This can result in delayed task completion and demonstrates that a one-size fits all concept should not apply to how software engineers work. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of different software engineers and their working styles we interviewed 21 participants and surveyed 868 software engineers at a large software company and asked them about their work in terms of knowledge worker actions. We identify how tasks, collaboration styles, and perspectives of autonomy can significantly effect different approaches to software engineering work. To characterize differences, we describe empirically informed personas on how they work.

Recently, a small group of studies suggests that, in addition to its technical and economic consequences, TD can affect developers' psychological states and morale. However, until now there has been a lack of empirical research clarifying such influences. Aims: In this study, we aim at taking the first step in filling this gap by investigating the potential impacts of TD and its management on developers' morale. Method: Drawing from previous literature on morale, we decided to explore the influence of TD and its management on three dimensions of morale called affective, future/goal, and interpersonal antecedents. In so doing, we conducted an exploratory field study and collected data from software professionals active in different industrial domains through eight qualitative interviews and an online survey (n=33). Results: Our results indicate that TD mainly has a negative influence on future/goal and affective antecedents of morale. This is mainly because the occurrence of TD hinders developers from performing their tasks and achieving their goals. TD management, on the other hand, has a positive influence on all the three dimensions of morale since it is associated with positive feelings and interpersonal feedback as well as a sense of progress. Conclusions: According to the results of this empirical study, the occurrence of TD reduces developers' morale, while its management increases developers' morale.","","","10.1109/ESEM.2017.53","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ESEM.2017.53","","","","","","0","62","","","","","",""

However, identifying proper strategies is not an easy task. This paper presents two studies performed to investigate how strategies can be established to achieve IT service goals. First, we carried out a qualitative study involving three IT service-related departments of a large company to find out how they have been defining strategies and problems faced. We noted that strategies were defined by leaders, in a top-down approach, or by teams, in a bottom-up approach, and causal analysis techniques have been used to investigate aspects which can impact goals achievement. We also found the relation between the IT service strategies and goals was not clear for the teams. Considering these findings, we performed an empirical study in another IT-service related department applying an approach combining GQM+Strategies plus some instruments (checklists, templates and examples) and causal analysis to support IT strategies identification. As a result, we noticed that by using that approach the team was able to derive IT strategies based on goals, define measures to monitor goals and strategies, and better understand the alignment between the goals to be achieved and the strategies to be performed. Moreover, results showed that causal analysis is useful to define strategies and that supporting instruments facilitate using the approach and building GQM+Strategies grid.","","","10.1109/ESEM.2017.51","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ESEM.2017.51","","","","","","2","44","","","","","",""

However, the magnitude (degree and power) of the effect of these sampling methods on the classification and prioritization performances of defect prediction models is still unknown. Goal: To investigate the statistical and practical significance of using resampled data for constructing defect prediction models. Method: We examine the practical effects of six data sampling methods on performances of five defect prediction models. The prediction performances of the models trained on default datasets (no sampling method) are compared with that of the models trained on resampled datasets (application of sampling methods). To decide whether the performance changes are significant or not, robust statistical tests are performed and effect sizes computed. Twenty releases of ten open source projects extracted from the PROMISE repository are considered and evaluated using the AUC, pd, pf and G-mean performance measures. Results: There are statistical significant differences and practical effects on the classification performance (pd, pf and G-mean) between models trained on resampled datasets and those trained on the default datasets. However, sampling methods have no statistical and practical effects on defect prioritization performance (AUC) with small or no effect values obtained from the models trained on the resampled datasets. Conclusions: Existing sampling methods can properly set the threshold between buggy and clean samples, while they cannot improve the prediction of defect-proneness itself. Sampling methods are highly recommended for defect classification purposes when all faulty modules are to be considered for testing.","","","10.1109/ESEM.2017.50","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ESEM.2017.50","","","","","","2","108","","","","","",""

However, little is known about relative performance of unsupervised and supervised models for effort-aware file-level defect prediction. Goal: Inspired by their work, we aim to investigate whether a similar finding holds in effort-aware file-level defect prediction. Method: We replicate Yang et al.'s study on PROMISE dataset with totally ten projects. We compare the effectiveness of unsupervised and supervised prediction models for effort-aware file-level defect prediction. Results: We find that the conclusion of Yang et al. [1] does not hold under within-project but holds under cross-project setting for file-level defect prediction. In addition, following the recommendations given by the best unsupervised model, developers needs to inspect statistically significantly more files than that of supervised models considering the same inspection effort (i.e., LOC). Conclusions: (a) Unsupervised models do not perform statistically significantly better than state-of-art supervised model under within-project setting, (b) Unsupervised models can perform statistically significantly better than state-of-art supervised model under cross-project setting, (c) We suggest that not only LOC but also number of files needed to be inspected should be considered when evaluating effort-aware file-level defect prediction models.","","","10.1109/ESEM.2017.48","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ESEM.2017.48","","","","","","3","72","","","","","",""

Method: We performed a survey with 22 release engineers to identify the importance of marketability release decision. We compared different classifiers to predict release marketability. For guiding the transition of not successfully marketable releases into successful ones, we used analogical reasoning. We evaluated our results both internally (over time) and externally (by developers). Results: Random forest classification performed best with F1 score of 78%. Analyzing 58 releases over time showed that, for 81% of them, analogical reasoning could correctly identify changes in the majority of release attributes.

Several quality management (QM) tools have been developed in recent years. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the quality of QM tools, standardized definitions of such quality, and reliable instruments for measuring it. This, in turn, impedes proper selection and improvement of QM tools. Goals: We aimed at operationalizing the quality of a research QM tool, namely the ProDebt prototype, and evaluating its quality. The goal of the ProDebt prototype is to provide practitioners with support for managing software quality and technical debt. Method: We performed interviews, workshops, and a mapping study to operationalize the quality of the ProDebt prototype and to identify reliable instruments to measure it. We designed a mixed-method study aimed at formative evaluation, i.e., at assessing the quality of the ProDebt prototype and providing guidance for its further development. Eleven practitioners from two German companies evaluated the ProDebt prototype. Results: The participants assessed the information provided by the ProDebt prototype as understandable and relevant. They considered the ProDebt prototype's functionalities as easy to use but of limited usability. They identified improvement needs, e.g., that the analysis results should be linked to other information sources. Conclusions: The evaluation design was of practical value for evaluating the ProDebt prototype considering the limited resources such as the practitioners time. The evaluation results provided the developers of the ProDebt prototype with guidance for its further development. We conclude that it can be used and tailored for replication or evaluation of other QM tools.","","","10.1109/ESEM.2017.43","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ESEM.2017.43","","","","","","1","90","","","","","",""

[Method] We report the results of an online comprehensibility experiment involving 61 professionals with an average of 9 years of working experience, in which we compared the ability to comprehend security risk assessments represented in tabular, UML-style with textual labels, and iconic graphical modeling notations. [Results] Tabular notation are still the most comprehensible notion in both recall and precision. However, the presence of textual labels does improve the precision and recall of participants over iconic graphical models. [Conclusion] Tabular representation better supports extraction of correct information of both simple and complex comprehensibility questions about security risks than the graphical notation but textual labels help.","","","10.1109/ESEM.2017.40","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ESEM.2017.40","","","","","","2","38","","","","","",""

Aim: In this article, we seek to understand the concept of mature teams in the context of SE, from the perspective of the software engineers themselves. Methods: We performed an exploratory qualitative research, collecting data from 26 practitioners, from 6 companies in 4 cities in Brazil. Data was analyzed using coding techniques from qualitative research. Results: Our findings pointed out three major dimensions of the concept of Team Maturity - Learning, Relationship and Technical Maturity - which, when kept in balance, can enhance the collective productivity, product quality and also the customer satisfaction. Conclusions: These results extend our current understanding of maturity of SE teams, shedding light on aspects that have been little explored so far in this field. The proposed model can serve as a guide for teams to enhance their approach of teamwork and for future research in this area.","","","10.1109/ESEM.2017.36","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ESEM.2017.36","","","","","","0","64","","","","","",""

These roles can have different degrees of autonomy depending on some factors, such as the adopted process and hierarchy. Goal: This study aims to identify what factors can impact autonomy and also investigate how autonomy is given to an employee based on two main factors: education level and professional experience. Methodology: Initially, a survey was carried out to understand how autonomy is perceived by 102 software engineers, as well as by 83 professionals from other areas. The next step was applying semi-structured interviews with software engineers to find a better understanding of the quantitative findings. Results: In general, education level and professional experience do not have an impact on autonomy. Only when autonomy is evaluated from the education level perspective, there is a significant difference among the respondents. During the interviews, we also could identify some topics that respondents mentioned which were related to autonomy. For example, the experience that software engineer has in a current project and the development process adopted by the company influence how autonomy is perceived. Conclusion: While professional qualification and experience are not directly related to autonomy, the lack of process and the amount of work experience on specific projects seem to be relevant factors to be aware of.","","","10.1109/ESEM.2017.35","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ESEM.2017.35","","","","","","0","34","","","","","",""

This paper examines how software development practitioners experience the need for notifying users when involving them in experimentation. Method: We conducted a survey within four software companies, inviting employees in different functional roles to indicate their attitudes and perceptions through a number of statements. Results: Employees working in different roles have different viewpoints on ethical issues. While managers are more conscious about company-customer relationships, UX designers appear more familiar with involving users. Developers think that details of experiments can be withheld from users if the results depend on it.

To date most SLRs have been conducted using a search strategy involving several digital libraries. However, significant issues have been reported for digital libraries and applying such search strategy requires substantial effort. On the other hand, snowballing has recently arisen as a potentially more efficient alternative or complementary solution. Nevertheless, it requires a relevant seed set of papers. [Aims] This paper proposes and evaluates a hybrid search strategy combining searching in a specific digital library (Scopus) with backward and forward snowballing. [Method] The proposed hybrid strategy was applied to two previously published SLRs that adopted database searches. We investigate whether it is able to retrieve the same included papers with lower effort in terms of the number of analysed papers. The two selected SLRs relate respectively to elicitation techniques (not confined to Software Engineering (SE)) and to a specific SE topic on cost estimation. [Results] Our results provide preliminary support for the proposed hybrid search strategy as being suitable for SLRs investigating a specific research topic within the SE domain. Furthermore, it helps overcoming existing issues with using digital libraries in SE. [Conclusions] The hybrid search strategy provides competitive results, similar to using several digital libraries. However, further investigation is needed to evaluate the hybrid search strategy.","","","10.1109/ESEM.2017.30","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ESEM.2017.30","","","","","","1","50","","","","","",""

Several studies show that the performance of a software engineering technology (e.g., prediction model) differs across different project repositories. Thus, it is important that the project selection is replicable. The aim of this paper is to present STRESS, a semi-automated and fully replicable approach that allows researchers to select projects by configuring the desired level of diversity, fit, and quality. STRESS records the rationale behind the researcher decisions and allows different users to re-run or modify such decisions. STRESS is open-source and it can be used used locally or even online (www.falessi.com/STRESS/). We perform a systematic mapping study that considers studies that analyzed projects managed with JIRA and Git to asses the project selection replicability of past studies. We validate the feasible application of STRESS in realistic research scenarios by applying STRESS to select projects among the 211 Apache Software Foundation projects. Our systematic mapping study results show that none of the 68 analyzed studies is completely replicable. Regarding STRESS, it successfully supported the project selection among all 211 ASF projects. It also supported the measurement of 100 projects characteristics, including the 32 criteria of the studies analyzed in our mapping study.

Aims: Change Impact Analysis (CIA) refers to the identification of source code files impacted when implementing a change request. We extend this question to predict not only affected files, but also the effort needed for implementing the change, and the duration necessary for that. Method: This study evaluates the performance of three textual similarity techniques for CIA based on Bag of words in combination with either topic modeling or file coupling. Results: The approaches are applied on data from two industrial projects. The data comes as part of an industrial collaboration project with Brightsquid, a Canadian start-up company specializing in secure communication solutions. Performance analysis shows that combining textual similarity with file coupling improves impact prediction, resulting in Recall of 67%.

Considering the importance of software testing to the development of high quality and reliable software systems, this paper aims to investigate how can work-related factors influence the motivation of software testers. Method. We applied a questionnaire that was developed using a previous theory of motivation and satisfaction of software engineers to conduct a survey-based study to explore and understand how professional software testers perceive and value work-related factors that could influence their motivation at work. Results. With a sample of 80 software testers we observed that software testers are strongly motivated by variety of work, creative tasks, recognition for their work, and activities that allow them to acquire new knowledge, but in general the social impact of this activity has low influence on their motivation. Conclusion. This study discusses the difference of opinions among software testers, regarding work-related factors that could impact their motivation, which can be relevant for managers and leaders in software engineering practice.","","","10.1109/ESEM.2017.16","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ESEM.2017.16","","","","","","2","84","","","","","",""

This is an interesting question that no previous study, to the best of our knowledge, has tried to answer. In this paper, we present a method for implementing a what-if scenario analysis estimating the number of defective files in the absence of smells. Our industrial case study shows that 20% of the total defective files were likely avoidable by avoiding smells. Such estimation needs to be used with the due care though as it is based on a hypothetical history (i.e., zero number of smells and same process and product change characteristics). Specifically, the number of defective files could even increase for some types of smells. In addition, we note that in some circumstances, accepting code with smells might still be a good option for a company.","","","10.1109/ESEM.2017.14","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ESEM.2017.14","","Software maintenance","","","","2","81","","","","","",""
"On the influence of human factors for identifying code smells: a multi-trial empirical study","Rafael Maiani de Mello; Roberto Oliveira; Alessandro Garcia","Banco do Brasil and PUC-Rio, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; PUC-Rio, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; PUC-Rio, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","ESEM '17: Proceedings of the 11th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement","","2017","","","68","77","Context: Code smells are symptoms in the source code that represent poor design choices. Professional developers often perceive several types of code smells as indicators of actual design problems. However, the identification of code smells involves multiple steps that are subjective in nature, requiring the engagement of humans. Human factors are likely to play a key role in the precise identification of code smells in industrial settings. Unfortunately, there is limited knowledge about the influence of human factors on smell identification. Goal: We aim at investigating whether the precision of smell identification is influenced by three key human factors, namely reviewer's professional background, reviewer's module knowledge and collaboration of reviewers during the task. We also aim at deriving recommendations for allocating human resources to smell identification tasks. Method: We performed 19 comparisons among different subsamples from two trials of a controlled experiment conducted in the context of an empirical study on code smell identification. One trial was conducted in industrial settings while the other had involved graduate students. The diversity of the samples allowed us to analyze the influence of the three factors in isolation and in conjunction. Results: We found that (i) reviewers' collaboration significantly increases the precision of smell identification, but (ii) some professional background is required from the reviewers to reach high precision. Surprisingly, we also found that: (iii) having previous knowledge of the reviewed module does not affect the precision of reviewers with higher professional background. However, this factor was influential on successful identification of more complex smells. Conclusion: We expect that our findings are helpful to support researchers in conducting proper experimental procedures in the future. Besides, they may also be useful for supporting project managers in allocating resources for smell identification tasks.","","","10.1109/ESEM.2017.13","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ESEM.2017.13","","","","","","2","72","","","","","",""
"An empirical examination of the relationship between code smells and merge conflicts","Iftekhar Ahmed; Caius Brindescu; Umme Ayda Mannan; Carlos Jensen; Anita Sarma","Oregon State University; Oregon State University; Oregon State University; Oregon State University; Oregon State University","ESEM '17: Proceedings of the 11th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement","","2017","","","58","67","Background: Merge conflicts are a common occurrence in software development. Researchers have shown the negative impact of conflicts on the resulting code quality and the development workflow. Thus far, no one has investigated the effect of bad design (code smells) on merge conflicts. Aims: We posit that entities that exhibit certain types of code smells are more likely to be involved in a merge conflict. We also postulate that code elements that are both smelly and involved in a merge conflict are associated with other undesirable effects (more likely to be buggy). Method: We mined 143 repositories from GitHub and recreated 6,979 merge conflicts to obtain metrics about code changes and conflicts. We categorized conflicts into semantic or non-semantic, based on whether changes affected the Abstract Syntax Tree. For each conflicting change, we calculate the number of code smells and the number of future bug-fixes associated with the affected lines of code. Results: We found that entities that are smelly are three times more likely to be involved in merge conflicts. Method-level code smells (Blob Operation and Internal Duplication) are highly correlated with semantic conflicts. We also found that code that is smelly and experiences merge conflicts is more likely to be buggy. Conclusion: Bad code design not only impacts maintainability, it also impacts the day to day operations of a project, such as merging contributions, and negatively impacts the quality of the resulting code. Our findings indicate that research is needed to identify better ways to support merge conflict resolution to minimize its effect on code quality.","","","10.1109/ESEM.2017.12","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ESEM.2017.12","","Software maintenance","","","","4","91","","","","","",""

We combine the analysis of facial expressions and attention to find a way to generate an episodic memory timeline which matches each individual person. We use face shape deformations and eye gaze to understand when a person has a change of facial expression and associate this with a narrative event. To evaluate our assumption, we performed an experiment where several subjects watch a short video while their physical reactions were recorded; then our software generates an episodic memory timeline based on those reactions. We found that, even with the same video, the episodic memory timeline for each subject was unique. We found as well, that physical reactions and participant's memory recalls, were consistent with the generated episodic memory timeline.","","","10.1145/3001773.3014352","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3001773.3014352","","Information systems","","","","1","74","","","","","",""

We report on a within-subject experiment where participants were tasked with transitioning between different environments. One set of transitions required the full physical motion of the user to complete, for the other set completing the transition was triggered after a part of the physical movement was performed up to a threshold. Results showed a clear preference for the second variant and thus for less control over the virtual camera.","","","10.1145/3001773.3001824","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3001773.3001824","","Human-centered computing","","","","2","201","","","","","",""

In conventional puppetry, there is also the need for practice in the manipulation of the puppets to achieve good performance. The proposed telepresence system addresses these issues by enabling the human performer to manipulate the puppet through their own body and facial movements.

The acceleration sensation can be enhanced by giving countercurrent which consists of an opposite current part and a forwarding current part. Conventionally, however, the degree of the enhancement is uncontrollable. This study reports that the effect of countercurrent can be modeled by an electrical circuit containing a capacitor and resistors. To model the effect of the countercurrent on the acceleration perception, we investigated the relation between the parameters: the duration and the strength of the opposite current part, of the countercurrent and strength of acceleration perception. The results of our study show that the strength of the acceleration sensation induced by the countercurrent stimulation has a nonlinear correlation with the duration of the opposite current, and the characteristics of the enhancement effect can be estimated using a CR circuit model.","","","10.1145/3001773.3001785","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3001773.3001785","","Human computer interaction (HCI)","","","","2","92","","","","","",""

Results -- We identified that the managers' perceptions about developers' productivity are influenced by four different factors: (1) tasks delivered on time, (2) produced artifacts that do not need rework, (3) products that meet stakeholders' expectations, and (4) personal behavior such as focus and proactivity. Conclusions -- This qualitative study shows a perception of developers' productivity different from that presented in other research papers, and suggests that human factors play an important role in managers' perceptions about productivity. Future work will investigate how these perceptions concretely influence developers' productivity, and how they relate to the existing developers' productivity factors in the literature.","","","10.1145/2961111.2962626","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2961111.2962626","","","","","","5","270","","","","","",""

Many critical systems must meet safety compliance needs from safety standards. These standards are usually large textual documents whose compliance needs can be hard to understand. As a solution, the use of models has been proposed. Goal. We aim to provide evidence of the extent to which models improve the understanding of safety compliance needs. Method. We designed an experiment and ran a pilot to study the effectiveness, efficiency, and perceived benefits of understanding these needs, with the text of standards and with models in the form of UML object diagrams. Results. The overall results from 15 Bachelor students show that the effectiveness of understanding safety compliance needs increases very little with models (2%), and the efficiency even decreases (24%). Nonetheless, the results improve when the potential complexity in navigating the models is taken into account (15% effectiveness increase). The students find benefits in using the models but most consider that the models are hard to understand. Conclusions. The extent to which models improve the understanding of safety compliance needs seems to be lower than what the research community expects.

However, when the phenomenon has not been fully discovered or understood, pilot case studies are important to refine the research problem, the research variables, and the case study design before launching a full-scale investigation. The role of pilot case studies has not been fully addressed in empirical software engineering research literature. Objective: To explore the use of pilot case studies in the design of full-scale case studies, and to report the main lessons learned from an industrial pilot study. Method: We designed and conducted an exploratory case study to identify new relevant research variables that influence the innovative behaviour of software engineers in the industrial setting and to refine the full-scale case study design for the next phase of our research. Results: The use of a pilot case study identified several important research variables that were missing in the initial framework. The pilot study also supported a more sophisticated case study design, which was used to guide a full-scale study. Conclusions: When a research topic is has not been fully discovered or understood, it is difficult to create a case study design that covers the relevant research variables and their potential relationships. Conducting a full-scale case study using an untested case design can lead to waste of resources and time if the design has to be reworked during the study. In these situations, the use of pilot case studies can significantly improve the case study design.","","","10.1145/2961111.2962618","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2961111.2962618","","","","","","1","152","","","","","",""

Estimating the SLOC of a project is very difficult in early stages of the software lifecycle, especially for software maintenance tasks. Depending on the reuse model being used, one would need to size the existing code that needs modifications and the size of the changes being made in SLOC. Functional size measures, such as Function Points (FPs) and the Software Non-functional Assessment Process (SNAP), have been developed to improve the ability to estimate project size early in the lifecycle for both development and maintenance projects. While FPs represent software size by functions; SNAP complements FPs by sizing non-functional requirements, such as data operations and interface design. Goal: SNAP complements Function Points by sizing non-functional requirements, such as data operations and interface design. Through an empirical analysis, the authors want to determine whether SNAP might be an effective software size measure individually or in conjunction with FPs to improve effort estimation accuracy. Method: The empirical analysis will be run on Unified Code Count (UCC)'s dataset, a software tool maintained by University of Southern California (USC). Results: The analyses found that separating projects adding new functions from those modifying existing functions resulted in improved estimation models using SNAP. The effort estimation model for projects modifying functions in UCC had high prediction accuracy statistics, but less impressive results for projects adding existing functions to UCC. The effort estimation accuracy were satisfactory when using SNAP in conjunction with FPs for both groups of projects. Conclusions: SNAP, indeed, complements FPs in terms of the requirements that are considered and sized. Both size metrics should be treated as individual metrics, but can be used together for acceptably accurate cost models in UCC's development environment.","","","10.1145/2961111.2962615","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2961111.2962615","","","","","","2","179","","","","","",""

The effort of these tasks need to be estimated to track progress, manage resources, and make decisions. Most widely used cost models use source lines of code (SLOC) as the software size input measure, due to its quantifiability and high correlation with effort. Estimating the SLOC of a project is very difficult in early stages of the software lifecycle. Function Points (FPs) represents software size by functions or modifications to functions, making them easier to calculate early in the lifecycle for new development projects or maintenance tasks. Several cost estimators use FPs to estimate the SLOC of a project to take advantage of existing cost models. Goal: Through empirical analysis, the authors want to determine whether FPs can effectively estimate maintenance tasks, as a better alternative to using SLOC as a software size metric. Additionally, the authors will demonstrate that FPs to SLOC ratios add uncertainty to effort estimates.

The effort estimation accuracy became unsatisfactorily low when using a FPs to SLOC ratio. Conclusions: Cost estimators should not use FPs to SLOC ratios for effort estimation due to low prediction accuracy. FPs is only an effective size measure for a portion of UCC's maintenance tasks - specifically for the projects adding new functions to UCC. Another size measure may need to be considered that might be more effective independently or in conjunction with FPs for all of UCC's maintenance tasks.","","","10.1145/2961111.2962613","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2961111.2962613","","","","","","10","277","","","","","",""

Aim: Investigate whether defect prediction can be improved using an explicit diversity technique with stacking ensemble, given the fact that different classifiers identify different sets of defects. Method: We used classifiers from four different families and the weighted accuracy diversity (WAD) technique to exploit diversity amongst classifiers. To combine individual predictions, we used the stacking ensemble technique. We used state-of-the-art knowledge in software defect prediction to build our ensemble models, and tested their prediction abilities against 8 publicly available data sets.

The factors that affect the decisions of the software project managers (SPMs) as well as their potential consequences require attention because project delays and failures might be related to a series of poor decisions. Goals: To understand how SPMs make decisions based on how they interpret their experiences in the workplace. Further, to identify antecedents and consequences of those decisions in order to increase the effectiveness of project management. We also aim to refine the research design for future investigations. Method: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with SPMs within a Brazilian large governmental organization and a Brazilian large private organization. Results: We found that decision-making in software project management is based on knowledge sharing in which the SPM acts as a facilitator. This phenomenon is influenced by individual factors, such as experience, knowledge, personality, organizational ability, communication, negotiation, interpersonal relationship and systemic vision of the project and by situational factors such as the autonomy of the SPM, constant feedback and team members' technical competence. Conclusions: Due to the uncertainty and dynamism inherent to software projects, the SPMs focus on making, monitoring and adjusting decisions in an argument-driven way. From the initial relationships among the identified factors, the research design was refined.","","","10.1145/2961111.2962604","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2961111.2962604","","","","","","1","218","","","","","",""

The sheer size of the configuration space makes the quality of software even harder to achieve. Performance is one of the key aspects of non-functional qualities, where performance bugs can cause significant performance degradation and lead to poor user experience. However, performance bugs are difficult to expose, primarily because detecting them requires specific inputs, as well as a specific execution environment (e.g., configurations). While researchers have developed techniques to analyze, quantify, detect, and fix performance bugs, we conjecture that many of these techniques may not be effective in highly-configurable systems. In this paper, we study the challenges that configurability creates for handling performance bugs. We study 113 real-world performance bugs, randomly sampled from three highly-configurable open-source projects: Apache, MySQL and Firefox. The findings of this study provide a set of lessons learned and guidance to aid practitioners and researchers to better handle performance bugs in highly-configurable software systems.","","","10.1145/2961111.2962602","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2961111.2962602","","","","","","10","338","","","","","",""

Goal: In order to uncover the latent clustering of mobile apps in app stores, we propose a novel technique that measures app similarity based on claimed behaviour. Method: Features are extracted using information retrieval augmented with ontological analysis and used as attributes to characterise apps. These attributes are then used to cluster the apps using agglomerative hierarchical clustering. We empirically evaluate our approach on 17,877 apps mined from the BlackBerry and Google app stores in 2014. Results: The results show that our approach dramatically improves the existing categorisation quality for both Blackberry (from 0.02 to 0.41 on average) and Google (from 0.03 to 0.21 on average) stores. We also find a strong Spearman rank correlation (ρ= 0.96 for Google and ρ= 0.99 for BlackBerry) between the number of apps and the ideal granularity within each category, indicating that ideal granularity increases with category size, as expected.

Identifying security goals is a process of iteration and refinement, leveraging the knowledge and expertise of the analyst to secure not only the core functionality but the security mechanisms as well. Moreover, a comprehensive security plan should include goals for not only preventing a breach, but also for detecting and appropriately responding in case a breach does occur. Goal: The objective of this research is to support analysts in security requirements engineering by providing a framework that supports a systematic and comprehensive discovery of security goals for a software system. Method: We develop a framework, Discovering Goals for Security (DIGS), that models the key entities in information security, including assets and security goals. We systematically develop a set of security goal patterns that capture multiple dimensions of security for assets. DIGS explicitly captures the relations and assumptions that underlie security goals to elicit implied goals. We map the goal patterns to NIST controls to help in operationalizing the goals. We evaluate DIGS via a controlled experiment where 28 participants analyzed systems from mobile banking and human resource management domains. Results: Participants considered security goals commensurate to the knowledge available to them. Although the overall recall was low given the empirical constraints, participants using DIGS identified more implied goals and felt more confident in completing the task. Conclusion: Explicitly providing the additional knowledge for the identification of implied security goals significantly increased the chances of discovering such goals, thereby improving coverage of stakeholder security requirements, even if they are unstated.","","","10.1145/2961111.2962599","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2961111.2962599","","","","","","7","250","","","","","",""

While inspections are effective, their overall team performance rely on inspectors' ability to detect and report faults. Our previous research showed that individual inspectors have varying LSs (i.e., they vary in their ability to process information recorded in requirements document). To extend the results of our previous LS research, this paper utilizes the concept of eye tracking (to record eye movements of inspectors) along with their LSs to detect reading patterns of inspectors during requirements inspections. Aim -- The objective of this research is to analyze the reading trends of effective and efficient inspectors using eye movement and LS data of individual inspectors and virtual inspection teams. Method -- The current research uses data (LS, eye tracking, and inspection) from thirteen inspectors to find its impact on inspection effectiveness and efficiency. Results -- Results from this study show that, inspectors who detect more faults during inspection, focus significantly more at the fault region to find and report faults as opposed to comprehending requirements information. Results also showed Inspection teams with diverse inspectors outperform similar teams and spend more time in comprehending information at the fault region. Additionally, results showed that inspectors with SEQ LS significantly tends to focus more at fault locations and are preferred for inspection.

Most existing quality improvement approaches focus on detection and removal of faults (i.e. problems recorded in a document) as opposed identifying the underlying errors that produced those faults. Accordingly, developers are likely to make the same errors in the future and fail to recognize other existing faults with the same origins. Therefore, we have created a Human Error Taxonomy (HET) to help software engineers improve their software requirement specification (SRS) documents. Aims: The goal of this paper is to analyze whether the HET is useful for classifying errors and for guiding developers to find additional faults. Methods: We conducted a empirical study in a classroom setting to evaluate the usefulness and feasibility of the HET. Results: First, software developers were able to employ error categories in the HET to identify and classify the underlying sources of faults identified during the inspection of SRS documents. Second, developers were able to use that information to detect additional faults that had gone unnoticed during the initial inspection. Finally, the participants had a positive impression about the usefulness of the HET. Conclusions: The HET is effective for identifying and classifying requirements errors and faults, thereby helping to improve the overall quality of the SRS and the software.","","","10.1145/2961111.2962596","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2961111.2962596","","","","","","4","384","","","","","",""

However, a bug fix can also be incomplete and even introduce new bugs. In such cases, extra effort is needed to rework the bug fix. The reworking requires to inspect the problem again, and perform the code change and verification when necessary. Discussions throughout the bug fixing process are important to clarify the reported problem and reach a solution. Aims: In this paper, we explore how discussions during the initial bug fix period (i.e., before the bug reworking occurs) associate with future bug reworking. We focus on two types of reworked bug fixes: 1) the initial bug fix made in a re-opened bug report; and 2) the initially submitted patch if multiple patches are submitted for a single bug report. Method: We perform a case study using five open source projects (i.e., Linux, Firefox, PDE, Ant and HTTP). The discussions are studied from six perspectives (i.e., duration, number of comments, dispersion, frequency, number of developers and experience of developers). Furthermore, we extract topics of discussions using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Results: We find that the occurrence of bug reworking is associated with various perspectives of discussions. Moreover, discussions on some topics (e.g., code inspection and code testing) can decrease the frequency of bug reworking. Conclusions: The discussions during the initial bug fix period may serve as an early indicator of what bug fixes are more likely to be reworked.","","","10.1145/2961111.2962591","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2961111.2962591","","","","","","5","185","","","","","",""

When consumers interact with a product, the brain captures and stores the related sensory experience in a multisensory representation in memory. Such memories serve consumers when making their future decisions. Thus, the senses play an important role in consumer behavior and the results of fMRI studies provide an interesting way for sensory marketers to analyze how the brain processes sensory information affecting product perception. In this article, we show how multisensory information, as well as mental simulation, impact taste expectations and subsequently taste, or better-said, flavor, perception in the light of neuroimaging studies. First, we discuss how neural analysis can help to understand the effect of marketing information on taste perception. Second, we highlight the role of gustatory inference on food perception in light of the latest fMRI findings.

We propose a bicycle pedaling training system using auditory feedback. The system generates feedback sound every time a pedal crank turns a quarter rotation. Users can keep the pedaling speed constant by synchronizing pedaling with the feedback sound with background music whose tempo is constant.

Additionally, because learners using previous learning method are stimulated by the indications of percussion performance information while stroking, perceiving these indications is not easy. We propose a learning method that presents the two phases separately. One of them is a phase where the learners receive the indications of performance information, and the other is a phase where they actually practice stroking. Learners first internalize rhythm through the indications of performance information. This separated learning method enables learners to learn the percussion more efficiently.

However, in almost all mobile AR applications, the user only views annotated information or the preset motion of the virtual object in an AR environment and is unable to interact with the virtual objects as if he/she were interacting with real objects in the real environment. In this paper, in an attempt to realize enhanced intuitive and realistic object manipulation in the mobile AR environment, we propose an integrated view-input AR interaction method, which integrates user device manipulation and virtual object manipulation. The method enables the user to hold a 3D virtual object by touching the displayed object on the 2D touch screen of a mobile device, and to move and rotate the object by moving and rotating the mobile device while viewing the held object by way of the 2D screen of the mobile device. Based on this concept, we implemented three types of integrated methods, namely the Rod, Center, and Touch methods, and conducted a user study to investigate the baseline performance metrics of the proposed method on an AR object manipulation task. The Rod method achieved the highest success rate (91%). Participants' feedback indicated that this is because the Rod method is the most natural, and evoked a fixed mental model that is conceivable in the real environment. These results indicated that visualizing the manipulation point on the screen and restricting the user's interactivity with virtual objects from the user's position of view based on a conceivable mental model would be able to aid the user to achieve precise manipulation.","","","10.1145/2832932.2832956","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2832932.2832956","","Virtual reality","","","","1","212","","","","","",""

Playfulness in photography has many implications regarding wider social behaviours. Comic annotations provide the ability to create humorous reinterpretations of photos, and the presence of humour and in-jokes affect the makeup of the audience with whom a group would like to share. It is counter-productive that an application encouraging such limiting behaviours may conflict with the open nature of touristic events. In addition, the shared images have an ephemeral quality and are therefore of transient value (compared to more tangible souvenirs), and their production through the application can ultimately distract from the experience of the visit itself.","","","10.1145/2832932.2832955","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2832932.2832955","","Human-centered computing","","","","0","90","","","","","",""

For enhancing the experience in a museum or exhibition, a voice recorder is useful for recording users' comments and providing explanations for the exhibitions. However, to utilize the sound log after the event, the voice recorder should attach appropriate tags to the sound data for extracting intended data from the long-term sound log. In a previous study, we have proposed an activity and context recognition method where the user carries a neck-worn receiver comprising a microphone and small speakers on his/her wrists that generate ultrasound. Our system also recognizes the location of the user and the people whom are near the user by ultrasonic ID signals generated from speakers placed in rooms and on people. In this study, we focus on embedding location/person IDs to sound logs by using ultrasonic IDs. We actually used the proposed method during a real event, and we confirmed that the wearing position of the microphone affects the accuracy of ultrasonic ID recognition because the acquired volume of ultrasound is different at each position. We propose a new method for recognizing the position of a microphone to improve the accuracy of ID recognition, and we actually use the improved method at another real event.

However, little research has been done on designing educational and entertaining interactive technology for kindergarten children (up to 5 years old). Furthermore, most of the work in this area has considered traditional input devices such as the mouse and keyboard, which are not suitable for these very young children. More recently, other more intuitive means of interaction (touch and tangible interfaces) and advanced educational artifacts such as robots have emerged. In this work we therefore present a joint collaboration between technologists and kindergarten instructors to design and evaluate a technological platform using a mobile robot for kindergarten instruction, as well as an intuitive and user-friendly tangible user interface. The results obtained suggest the platform is not only usable by kindergarten children, but it also allows them to be fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In addition, the instructors reported that the system was well accepted and praised its versatility in use as a supporting tool for their everyday classroom activities.","","","10.1145/2832932.2832952","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2832932.2832952","","Interface design prototyping","","","","9","143","","","","","",""

Yet, as experts point out, an overwhelming number of projects do not have rigorous Pedagogical foundations. Additionally, many existent educational game design frameworks have a one-size-fits-all approach. That is, they were conceived with a single domain of knowledge in mind or do not consider the personal characteristics of those involved in the learning process. To address these issues, we reviewed multiple case studies and design frameworks, and studied guidelines from Pedagogy. As a result, using techniques from Grounded Theory, we identified key design patterns and features present in educational games that may serve to attain learning goals. With this information, we created a model to analyze existing games and design new educational games with Pedagogical foundations. In this work we present our model, and we discuss our findings, limitations, and future work.","","","10.1145/2832932.2832951","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2832932.2832951","","Interactive games","","","","4","225","","","","","",""

However, experimental and behavioral influences of watching three-dimensional (3D) video in vibrating vehicles have not been widely researched. The goal of this study is 1) to explore the influence of video presentation modes (two-dimensional and stereoscopic 3D) on the quality of experience and 2) to understand the nature of the movement patterns that users perform to maintain an optimal viewing position while viewing videos on a mobile device in three commuting contexts and in a controlled laboratory environment. A hybrid method for quality evaluation was used for combining quantitative preference ratings, qualitative descriptions of quality, situational audio/video data-collection, and sensors. The high-quality and heterogeneous audiovisual stimuli were viewed on a mobile device equipped with a parallax barrier display. The results showed that the stereoscopic 3D (S3D) video presentation mode provided more satisfying quality of experience than the two-dimensional presentation mode in all studied contexts. To maintain an optimal viewing position in the vehicles, the users moved the device in their hands to the directions around the vertical and the horizontal axes in a leaned sitting position. This movement behavior was guided by the contexts but not by the quality, indicating the general importance of these results for mobile video viewing in vibrating vehicles.","","","10.1145/2832932.2832948","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2832932.2832948","","Human computer interaction (HCI)","","","","0","40","","","","","",""

Hence, we developed a system called MoveMe that provides three-dimensional haptic support for playing a musical instrument. The system guides a user's hands as if someone else was holding their hands to help a beginner play a musical instrument. With the system, an expert can pre-record his/her movements so that a beginner can play it back later as necessary. Alternatively, the system connects an expert and a beginner via two haptic robots and the expert can, in real time, guide and correct the beginner's movement. In addition to those functionalities, we introduce a new proficiency metric provided by force feedback. A master can evaluate how much a beginner has improved using both audio feedback as well as this new force-based metric. Through the experiments that we conducted, we found that our system is effective in terms of playing a song at a correct speed and rhythm.","","","10.1145/2832932.2832947","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2832932.2832947","","Human computer interaction (HCI)","","","","3","193","","","","","",""

Roving dogs have mauled humans and spread rabies, and stray dogs have also been the victims of brutal human campaigns to cull their numbers. Any effective intervention in the stray dog problem must address the human role in the crisis. I propose a mobile app, called DogTracker, that allows citizens and animal control officials to report sightings of stray dogs. Creating, mapping, and accessing these reports will help officials estimate the size and characteristics of the stray dog population, target humane population and disease control interventions, and identify communities in which to conduct public education. DogTracker can also provide information for citizens on movements of dogs and help citizens keep themselves and their communities safe from dangerous packs.","","","10.1145/2693787.2693798","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2693787.2693798","","Human-centered computing","","","","1","131","","","","","",""

Playful environments are, therefore, a promising scenario in which to start developing animal-centered ecosystems, and there are plenty of circumstances where playful environments could help to improve animals' well-being. However, developing a custom system for each possible context remains unfeasible, and more appealing solutions are required. If playful environments were equipped with intelligent capabilities, they could learn from the animals' behavior and automatically adapt themselves to the animals' needs and preferences by creating engaging playful activities for different purposes.

In this paper, in order to enhance the immersive experience, we upgraded the system based on the results of past preliminary evaluation. In the upgraded system, animals on the screen animate whenever an observer walks across the screen, and the animal under observation changes in response to the observer walking backward or forward towards the screen. In this way, the observer becomes part of the virtual paleontological environment. Then, in order to verify the upgrade's effectiveness, we conducted an evaluation. The results indicated that the upgrade of the system was effective in immersing observers because of the fidelity of the simulation and the enjoyment afforded by moving one's own body.","","","10.1145/2663806.2663866","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2663806.2663866","","Human computer interaction (HCI)","","","","0","94","","","","","",""

This also enables iterating through entities and performing proximity queries in a linear memory. Experiments conducted shows that the proposed algorithm is, on average, at least 3 times faster than existing solutions based on dynamic data structures.

In a typical approach to automatic choreography, a dance is constructed by concatenating segments of existing dances which are maximally correlated to the target audio features with connectivity constraints. However, researchers using this approach are unable to produce dances with much variety, since the set of examples used in these experiments (usually motion-capture of existing choreographies) is limited and costly to produce. To solve this issue, we propose a probabilistic model which maps beat structures to dance movements using a Gaussian process, trained with a large amount of consumer-generated dance motion obtained from the web. The main contribution of our work is the combination of two approaches: the previously mentioned correlation based approach which seeks for relationships between music and dance, and a machine learning approach which is based on human motion modeling. Inspection of the generated dances proves that our method can generate choreographies with different characters by switching the training dataset, and highlights opportunities in training with further dance motions on the web to generate more expressive dance choreography.","","","10.1145/2663806.2663849","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2663806.2663849","","Computer graphics","","","","3","187","","","","","",""

We conducted an evaluation study, with the real users of the application, which is available on the market, to gather the users' feedback regarding their experience and the use of the interaction method. Results may give a considerable contribution to future researchers in this field, regarding the challenges involved when deploying real-time interactions during live broadcasted events.","","","10.1145/2663806.2663843","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2663806.2663843","","Touch screens","","","","13","241","","","","","",""

While one user interacts with a small dome touchscreen and controls the harmonic sound space, the other user stands inside a larger dome creating melodies by continuous gestures in mid-air. Similar to a theremin notes are played without touch using an invisible two-dimensional melodic table of notes with a dedicated layout that allows creating harmonic expressions by continuous gestures. The generation of musical expressions is visualized on both instruments with several visualization techniques. For prototyping purposes and to illustrate the idea of the installation without the need to set up the complex installation we also provide an immersion user experience by simulating the system using an Oculus Rift head-mounted display.

Our approach builds on the combination of two strands of work: 1.) structuring and providing museum-assets as linked data, and 2.) template-based content creation for mobiles games. This is thought to facilitate reuse of existing data and foster its maintenance on the one hand, as well as providing a timely and engaging mobile interface to museum content on the other hand. Our study is based on two rounds of user-tests with think-aloud observations and questionnaires, and on the developers' notes and reflections that stem from introductory workshops at four natural history museums from the Natural Europe project consortium. We found that both, the workflow for content-creation and the mobile end-user app have high hedonic as well as pragmatic qualities. Thus, the test results indicate that our approach might provide guidance for future work in this domain.","","","10.1145/2663806.2663841","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2663806.2663841","","Hypertext / hypermedia","","","","8","159","","","","","",""

In addition, there are some characteristic issues that are particular to the shamisen, including the variable tempo of the music and the unique timbre of the instrument, which makes pitch detection difficult using standard techniques. In this work, we describe an application that automatically scrolls through a musical score, initially at a predefined tempo. Because there is often a difference between the predefined tempo and tempo with which the musician plays the piece, the application adjusts speed of the score scroll based on the input from a microphone. We evaluated the performance of the application via a user study.

In this paper, we identify two distinct dimensional balancing techniques: internal adjustment and external adjustment. We report results from a study where we measured player engagement after applying these adjustments to a digital table tennis game and the traditional table tennis game, finding two disengagement factors: unexpected physical challenges and unacceptable competitive advantage. Based on these factors we derived a set of exertion game design considerations. We conclude that applying digital technology to a physical game can change the required skill level to play the game, and this can affect the impact of these adjustments on player engagement.

However, we did not find quantitative evidence that attributes of social presence were higher from the Social Presence Game Questionnaire. Together, our findings suggest that placement of a physical NFC interface does not necessarily increase perceived social presence when users play collaboratively. However, social expansion in mobile collaborative pervasive games can greatly benefit from people's mutual awareness from such an interface. This mutual awareness has the potential to both attract users and spectators, and reduce anxiety of users to invite spectators, or accept an invite from users.","","","10.1145/2663806.2663835","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2663806.2663835","","Touch screens","","","","1","142","","","","","",""

Our system constructs a simple virtual space by allocating video frames and the people appearing in the clip within the user's 3D space. By measuring the user's 3D depth in real time, the time space of the video clip and the user's 3D space become mixed. VRMixer automatically extracts human images from a video clip by using a video segmentation technique based on 3D graph cut segmentation that employs face detection to detach the human area from the background. A virtual 3D space (i.e., 2.5D space) is constructed by positioning the background in the back and the people in the front. In the video clip, the user can stand in front of or behind the people by using a depth camera. Real objects that are closer than the distance of the clip's background will become part of the constructed virtual 3D space.

Eye makeup is especially important for face makeup, because eyeshadow color and eyeline shape can dramatically change a person's impression on others.

Artistic eye makeup often has a motif of characters or symbols, such as a butterfly, heart or rose. Needless to say, it is often difficult for non-artistic people to apply this type of eye makeup. Artistic eye makeup requires a special technique; therefore, we propose and implement a computer-aided eye makeup design system called iMake. This system generates artistic eye makeup designs from the colors and shapes of a favorite character selected by a user. Once the user has selected the desired eye makeup pattern, an ink-jet color printer prints it on a transfer sheet that the user can apply to his/her eyelids. The user can design any type of eye makeup with a simple operation, and then apply the transfer sheet makeup without any special techniques.

In a user study with 22 participants, the concept was found fun, interesting and said to provide new music listening experiences. Users were highly interested in the evolving avatar and seeing/listening to others' avatars. Users had several different avatar creation strategies that are very interesting for new music discovery. Users also listened to new types of music broadly using the avatars. Based on the results, the paper proposes design implications for using avatars in music discovery services.","","","10.1145/2663806.2663820","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2663806.2663820","","Music retrieval","","","","0","92","","","","","",""

Tests are still mainly designed and executed manually. In previous work we have described TESTAR, a tool which allows to set-up fully automatic testing at the GUI level of applications to find severe faults such as crashes or non-responsiveness. [Method] This paper aims at the evaluation of TESTAR with an industrial case study. The case study was conducted at SOFTEAM, a French software company, while testing their Modelio SaaS system, a cloud-based system to manage virtual machines that run their popular graphical UML editor Modelio. [Goal] The goal of the study was to evaluate how the tool would perform within the context of SOFTEAM and on their software application. On the other hand, we were interested to see how easy or difficult it is to learn and implant our academic prototype within an industrial setting. [Results] The effectiveness and efficiency of the automated tests generated with TESTAR can definitely compete with that of the manual test suite. [Conclusions] The training materials as well as the user and installation manual of TESTAR need to be improved using the feedback received during the study. Finally, the need to program Java-code to create sophisticated oracles for testing created some initial problems and some resistance. However, it became clear that this could be solved by explaining the need for these oracles and compare them to the alternative of more expensive and complex human oracles. The need to raise consciousness that automated testing means programming solved most of the initial problems.","","","10.1145/2652524.2652588","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2652524.2652588","","Metrics","","","","11","201","","","","","",""

Furthermore, we built linear and logistic regression models by using evolutionary coupling measures in order to explain defects. Although regression analysis results show that evolutionary coupling measures can be useful to explain defects, especially for modules in which high correlation is detected, explanatory power decreases dramatically with the decreasing correlation.","","","10.1145/2652524.2652577","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2652524.2652577","","Information systems applications","","","","10","258","","","","","",""

In order to foster empirical research, it is essential understand the environments, guidelines, process, and other mechanisms available to support these studies in SE. Goal: Identifying the mechanisms used to support the empirical strategies adopted by the researches in the major Empirical Software Engineering (ESE) scientific venues. Method: We performed a systematic mapping study that included all full papers published at EASE, ESEM and ESEJ since their first editions. A total of 898 studies were selected. Results: We provide the full list of identified support mechanisms and the strategies that uses them. The most commonly mechanisms used to support the empirical strategies were two sets of guidelines, one to secondary studies and another to experiments. The most reported empirical strategies are experiments and case studies. Conclusions: The use of empirical methods in SE has increased over the years but many studies do not apply these methods nor use mechanisms to guide their research. Therefore, the list of support mechanisms, where and how they were applied is a major asset to the SE community. Such asset can foster empirical studies aiding the choice regarding which strategies and mechanisms to use in a research. Also, we identified new perspectives and gaps that foster the development of resources to aid empirical studies.","","","10.1145/2652524.2652572","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2652524.2652572","","Software and its engineering","","","","2","234","","","","","",""

Although Cosmic Functional Size Measurement Method is one of the most known techniques to estimate effort and cost in software projects, there is little evidence that indicates how to adapt it to non-waterfall lifecycles, such as incremental ones. Goal: This paper presents an approach called Incremental CFP that allows estimating effort for each increment using Cosmic Function Points (CFP) and COCOMO's effort adjustment factor (EAF). Method: In order to validate this new approach, we employed data from two different projects in which undergraduate students had to work originally with IFPUG function points. Results: The results were considered as promising given that the difference between the estimated effort and the real effort was lower than 30% for the second increment. Conclusions: With a minimum difference between the estimated effort and the real effort, it was possible to establish that the proposed technique is acceptable and predictive. However, more study cases should be performed before generalizing its applicability for different contexts.","","","10.1145/2652524.2652571","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2652524.2652571","","Project and people management","","","","1","258","","","","","",""

Goal- In the search for alternatives of effective methods for synthesizing empirical evidence, in this paper, we explore the use of the Qualitative Metasummary method, which is a quantitatively oriented aggregation of mixed research findings. Method - We describe the use of qualitative metasummary through an example using 15 studies addressing antecedents of performance of software development teams. Qualitative metasummary includes extraction and grouping of findings, and calculation of frequency and intensity effect sizes.

Method: We designed an experiment, in which we ask students to draw a domain model from a given set of requirements written in active or passive voice. We compared the completeness of the resulting domain model by counting the number of missing actors, domain objects and their associations with respect to a specified solution. Results: While we could not see a difference in the number of missing actors and objects, participants which received passive sentences missed almost twice the associations.

Goal -- In this article, we aim to identify visible signs of a software engineer who is motivated to work. Method -- We describe a field study in which 62 practitioners in Brazil reported their view of motivation in the context of their practical work. Data was collected by means of audio-recorded semi-structured interviews, and a thematic analysis was applied to identify the most relevant descriptors of motivation. Results -- Our data reveal that (1) motivated Software Engineers are engaged, focused, and collaborative; and (2) the term motivation is used as an umbrella term to cover several distinct organizational behaviours that are not necessarily related to the individual's desire to work. Conclusions -- Without a clear picture of the difference between these two concepts, work-based motivation programs may not be designed effectively to address either turnover or performance issues. Overall, this work indicates the need for a more effective conceptual system to investigate and encourage both job satisfaction and work motivation in software engineering research and practice.","","","10.1145/2652524.2652545","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2652524.2652545","","Programming teams","","","","15","404","","","","","",""

It is unclear whether these motivations have any actual impact on OSS project success. <u>Goal:</u>To identify how an OSS developer's reputation affects the outcome of his/her code review requests. <u>Method:</u> We conducted a social network analysis (SNA) of the code review data from eight popular OSS projects. Working on the assumption that core developers have better reputation than peripheral developers, we developed an approach, Core Identification using K-means (CIK) to divide the OSS developers into core and periphery groups based on six SNA centrality measures. We then compared the outcome of the code review process for members of the two groups. <u>Results:</u> The results suggest that the core developers receive quicker first feedback on their review request, complete the review process in shorter time, and are more likely to have their code changes accepted into the project codebase. Peripheral developers may have to wait 2 - 19 times (or 12 - 96 hours) longer than core developers for the review process of their code to complete. <u>Conclusion:</u> We recommend that projects allocate resources or create tool support to triage the code review requests to motivate prospective developers through quick feedback.","","","10.1145/2652524.2652544","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2652524.2652544","","Software creation and management","","","","29","475","","","","","",""

[Goal] To investigate this problem, we developed and evaluated a technique to measure the degree of shared understanding and identify areas of similarity and difference. Adapted from the Pathfinder technique for evaluating Team Mental Models, this is a quantitative analysis of paired comparisons of design concepts as understood by the team. [Method] We performed an empirical, mixed-methods pilot study of the technique with 5 student teams developing a semester long project. We used questionnaires and interviews to evaluate the effectiveness of the technique in measuring areas of similarity and difference. We also investigated the association between differences in understanding and problems during development. [Results] Our results support the ability of the technique to identify and measure areas of similarity and difference. There is limited support for the association between differences and poor project outcomes. [Conclusions] We find these pilot results encouraging.

We study a collaboration program involving a total of nine Open Source Software projects and more than 120 students from different universities around the world as part of Facebook's Education Modernization Program. Method: We use quantitative measurements of source code repositories, issue tracking systems, and discussion fora to examine how newcomers become contributing members of their OSS projects. Results: We found that developers receiving deliberate onboarding support through mentoring were more active at an earlier stage than developers entering projects through conventional means.

However, understanding SAs' roles in the QRs engineering activities only recently became a topic in empirical requirements engineering research and very little is still known about QRs engineering from SAs' in large and distributed projects. Goal: This exploratory study aims at explicating how SAs are involved in engineering QRs in a specific distributed development setting, namely in organizations that distribute software development activities to closely located business units, known as near-shore development centres (NDCs), and in a specific geographic zone, namely Eastern Europe. Method: Based on interviews with 16 practitioners working on large projects in NDCs, we explicate the participation and involvement of NDCs' architects in QRs tasks. Results: We found that SAs from NDCs (i) are actively involved in QRs documentation and validation, (ii) are relatively passive participants in QRs elicitation and prioritization, and (iii) are not at all involved in QRs negotiation. Perhaps, our most surprising finding is that NDCs may often have economic incentives to misalign with onshore QRs practices. Conclusions: We explicated QRs practices, compared them to previously published ones, and found implications for both researchers and practitioners.

Goal: We performed an empirical study on reporters of buffer overflow vulnerabilities to understand the methods and tools used during the discovery. Method: We ran the study in the form of an email questionnaire with open ended questions. The participants were reporters featured in the SecurityFocus repository during two six-month periods; we collected 58 responses. Results: We found that in spite of many apparent choices, reporters follow similar approaches. Most reporters typically use fuzzing, but their fuzzing tools are created ad hoc; they use a few debugging tools to analyze the crash introduced by a fuzzer; and static analysis tools are rarely used. We also found a serious problem in the vulnerability reporting process. Most reporters, especially the experienced ones, favor full-disclosure and do not collaborate with the vendors of vulnerable software. They think that the public disclosure, sometimes supported by a detailed exploit, will put pressure on vendors to fix the vulnerabilities. But, in practice, the vulnerabilities not reported to vendors are less likely to be fixed.

In the source code, most of the data is unstructured data, such as the natural language text in comments and identifier names. Researchers in software engineering community have developed many techniques for handling such unstructured data, such as natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR). Before using the IR technique on the unstructured source code, we must preprocess the text identifies and comments since these data is different from that used in our daily life. During this process, several operations, i.e, tokenization, splitting, stemming, etc. are usually used for preprocessing the unstructured source code. These preprocessing operations will affect the quality of the data used in the IR process. But how these preprocessing operations affect the results of IR is still an open problem. To the best of our knowledge, there are still no studies focusin on this problem. This paper attempts to fill this gap, and conducts some empirical studies to show what are the differences before and after these preprocessing operations.

As an important research methodology in evidence-based software engineering, systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are used for identifying the evidence and critically appraising the evidence, i.e. empirical studies that report (empirical) data about specific research questions. The 80/20 Rule (or Pareto's Law) reveals a 'vital few' phenomenon widely observed in many disciplines in the last century. However, the applicability of Pareto's Law to evidence distribution in software engineering (SE) is never tested yet. The objective of this paper is to investigate the applicability of Pareto's Law to the evidence distribution on specific topic areas in software engineering (in the form of systematic reviews), which may help us better understand the possible distribution of evidence in software engineering, and further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of literature search. We performed a tertiary study of SLRs in software engineering dated between 2004 and 2012. We further tested the Pareto's Law by collecting, analyzing, and interpreting the distribution (over publication venues) of the primary studies reported in the existing SLRs. Our search identified 255 SLRs, 107 of which were included according to the selection criteria. The analysis of the extracted data from these SLRs presents a preliminary view of the evidence (study) distribution in software engineering. The nonuniform distribution of evidence is supported by the data from the existing SLRs in SE. However, the present observation reflects a weaker 'vital few' relation between study and venue than the 80/20 Rule statement. Top referenced venues are suggested when researchers search for studies in software engineering. It is also noticeable to the community that the primary studies are improperly or incompletely reported in many SLRs.","","","10.1145/2627508.2627510","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2627508.2627510","","Software configuration management and version control systems","","","","0","71","","","","","",""

The higher the mutation score the more successful the test suite will be at detecting faults. The SQLMutation tool was used to generate query mutants from beginner-level sample schemas obtained from three popular real-world database test suite vendors -- MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. Four SQLMutation operators were applied to both real-world and NIST SQL vendor compliance test suites - SQL Clause (SC), Operator Replacement (OR), NULL (NL) and Identifier Replacement (IR). Two mutation operators, SC and NL generated significantly lower mutation scores in real-world test suites than for those in the vendor test suite. The IR operator generated significantly higher mutation scores in real-world test suites than for those in the vendor test suite. The OR operator produced roughly the same mutation scores in both the real-world and vendor test suites.","","","10.1145/2372251.2372310","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2372251.2372310","","Query languages","","","","1","180","","","","","",""

Objective: In this paper we analyze 61 projects looking for a relationship between process structured and quality of the product. The structure is considered under two dimensions: level of maturity (as measured by the CMMI assessment model) and type (e.g. TSP, RUP). The quality of the product is measured in terms of Defect Density (DD) defined as the number of delivered defects divided per size. Results: We found a small and statistically not significant difference of DD between the projects developed under CMMI and those that are not developed under CMMI. Considering the CMMI levels, the pair (CMMI 1, CMMI 3) is characterized by a statistically significant different DD. CMMI 1 exhibiting higher DD than CMMI 3. By comparing different software processes with each other we found that Hybrid process exhibits statistically significant lower DD than Waterfall.

The need to move code across branches introduces addition-al overhead and branch use can lead to integration failures due to conflicts or unseen dependencies. Although branches are used ex-tensively in commercial and open source development projects, the effects that different branch strategies have on software quality are not yet well understood. In this paper, we present the first empirical study that evaluates and quantifies the relationship between soft-ware quality and various aspects of the branch structure used in a software project. We examine Windows Vista and Windows 7 and compare components that have different branch characteristics to quantify differences in quality. We also examine the effectiveness of two branching strategies -- branching according to the software architecture versus branching according to organizational structure. We find that, indeed, branching does have an effect on software quality and that misalignment of branching structure and organiza-tional structure is associated with higher post-release failure rates.","","","10.1145/2372251.2372305","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2372251.2372305","","Process validation","","","","39","410","","","","","",""

Post object-oriented programming techniques are increasingly providing expressive mechanisms to enable the flexible definition of composition code. Such composition mechanisms are intended to support programmers in factoring out the complexity of a program and facilitate its evolution. However, the properties of composition code might introduce new flavours of complexity, and in turn cause side effects on program evolvability. Unfortunately, the role of composition code properties on evolving software systems is not yet well understood. This gap is mostly due to the lack of a measurement framework to characterize and quantify composition code. Existing metrics suites are focused on quantifying properties of programs and their modules only. Therefore, programmers are not able to analyse and understand the impact of particular composition properties on program evolvability. This paper presents a framework aimed at characterizing and computing composition code properties. The proposed framework consists of terminology and a metrics suite, which can be used in programs structured with diverse sets of composition mechanisms. We also empirically studied the role of the measurement framework through 22 versions of 4 software projects.

However, simulation through confident models represents an interesting strategy to support software decay observation in short period of time. Towards that, this paper describes a model aimed at supporting the software decay simulation through systems dynamics. The Laws of Software Evolution and ISO 9126 were used as initial knowledge to support the discovery of software characteristic (size, periodicity, complexity, effort, reliability, and maintainability) relationships. Next, evidence to strengthen the existence of such relationships was acquired through quasi-systematic literature reviews. In sequence, the model was applied to support the simulation of industrial software decay. The results suggested its feasibility and correctness, making it an interesting candidate to support future software decay studies.","","","10.1145/2372251.2372303","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2372251.2372303","","Software creation and management","","","","0","261","","","","","",""

Such selection relies on human judgment, possibly supported by structured prioritization techniques and tools. Goal: Our goal was to investigate whether certain attributes of prioritization techniques affect stakeholders' threshold for judging product features as essential. The four investigated techniques represent four combinations of granularity (low, high) and cognitive support (low, high). Method: To control for robustness and masking effects when investigating in the field, we conducted both an artificial experiment and a field experiment using the same prioritization techniques. In the artificial experiment, 94 subjects in four treatment groups indicated the features (from a list of 16) essential when buying a new cell phone. In the field experiment, 44 domain experts indicated the software product features that were essential for the fulfillment of the project's vision. The effects of granularity and cognitive support on the number of essential ratings were analyzed and compared between the experiments. Result: With lower granularity, significantly more features were rated as essential. The effect was large in the general experiment and extreme in the field experiment. Added cognitive support had medium effect, but worked in opposite directions in the two experiments, and was not statistically significant in the field experiment. Implications: Software projects should avoid taking stakeholders' judgments of essentiality at face value. Practices and tools should be designed to counteract biases and to support the conscious knowledge-based elements of prioritizing.","","","10.1145/2372251.2372300","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2372251.2372300","","Rapid application development","","","","2","282","","","","","",""

A typical activity to maximise testing productivity is to allocate test cases according to the testers' profile. However, optimising the allocation of manual test cases is not a trivial task: in big companies, test managers are responsible for allocating hundreds of test cases among several testers. OBJECTIVE: In this paper we propose and evaluate 2 assignment algorithms for test case allocation and 3 tester profiles based on recommender systems. Each assignment algorithm can be combined with 3 tester profiles, which results in six possible allocation systems. METHOD: We run a controlled experiment that uses 100 test suites, each one with at least 50 test cases, from a real industrial setting in order to compare our allocation systems to the manager's allocation in terms of precision, recall and unassignment (percentage of test cases the algorithm could not allocate). RESULTS: In our experiment, the statistical analysis shows that one of the systems outperforms the others with respect to the precision and recall metrics. For unassignment, three of our six allocation systems achieved zero (best value) for the unassignment rate. CONCLUSION: The results of our experiment suggest that, in similar environments, test managers can use our allocation systems to reduce the amount of time spent in the test case allocation task. In the real industrial setting in which our work was developed, managers spend from 16 to 30 working days a year on test case allocation. Our algorithms can help them do it faster and better.","","","10.1145/2372251.2372289","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2372251.2372289","","Software testing and debugging","","","","5","318","","","","","",""

In our method, we first construct defect state transition models using historical data. We then derive a stability metric from the transition models to measure a project's defect-fixing performance. For projects with stable defect-fixing performance, we show that we can apply Markovian method to predict the number of defects at each state in future based on the state transition model. We evaluate the effectiveness of BugStates using six open source projects and the results are promising. For example, when predicting defect numbers at each state in December 2010 using data from July 2009 to June 2010, the absolute errors for all projects are less than 28.

There is significant literature investigating models for predicting which modules in a system will become volatile, and/or are defect-prone. Much of this work focuses on using source code-related characteristics (e.g., complexity metrics) and simple change metrics (e.g., number of past changes) as inputs to the predictive models. Our work attempts to broaden the array of factors considered in such prediction approaches. To this end, we collected data directly from development personnel about the factors they rely on to foresee what parts of a system are going to become volatile. In this paper, we describe a focus group study conducted with the development team of a small but active open source project, in which we asked this very question. The results of the focus group indicate, among other things, that a period of volatility in a particular area of the system is often predicted by a pattern characterized by inactivity in a certain area (resulting in that area becoming less mature than others), increased communication between developers regarding opportunities for improvement in that area, and then the emergence of a champion who takes the initiative to start working on those improvements. The initial changes lead to more changes (both to extend the improvements already made and to fix problems introduced), thus leading to volatility.","","","10.1145/2372251.2372286","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2372251.2372286","","Software configuration management and version control systems","","","","0","240","","","","","",""

However, most of those approaches predict bugs on file-level. This often leaves developers with a considerable amount of effort to examine all methods of a file until a bug is located. This particular problem is reinforced by the fact that large files are typically predicted as the most bug-prone. In this paper, we present bug prediction models at the level of individual methods rather than at file-level. This increases the granularity of the prediction and thus reduces manual inspection efforts for developers. The models are based on change metrics and source code metrics that are typically used in bug prediction. Our experiments---performed on 21 Java open-source (sub-)systems---show that our prediction models reach a precision and recall of 84% and 88%, respectively. Furthermore, the results indicate that change metrics significantly outperform source code metrics.","","","10.1145/2372251.2372285","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2372251.2372285","","Formal methods","","","","43","710","","","","","",""

SmartOffice was integrated with a legacy system supporting the import management process of a large German retailer. We evaluated the SmartOffice integration in an empirical study in the context of the import process, using real data, and with the employees of the retailer's import office. We conducted a semi-structured interview, where one participant answered questions after solving three typical tasks and surveyed a group after a presentation and demonstration of SmartOffice's functionality. The results show that SmartOffice has high potential for being introduced in the process with high efficiency and high user acceptance. Although the number of participants was low, the results are considered very relevant from the perspective of the domain experts, since the study took place in an industrial setting.","","","10.1145/2372251.2372281","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2372251.2372281","","Project and people management","","","","1","101","","","","","",""

Inspection effectiveness and efficiency may be affected by a variety of factors such as inspection planning, the type of software, the developing organization, and many others. In the early 1990's, a governmental organization developing complex and highly critical software systems formulated heuristics for inspection planning based on best practices and their early inspection data. Since the development context at the organization has changed in some ways since the heuristics were proposed, it is important to assess whether the heuristics are still a suitable guideline to use. To investigate this question, we statistically evaluated the differences in effectiveness and efficiency between inspections that adhered to the heuristics and ones that did not. Our analysis revealed no significant difference in effectiveness or efficiency for most heuristics.

For this purpose, we conducted an extensive survey among Finnish software practitioners in 2011, using the membership registry of The Finnish Information Processing Association (FIPA) as a sampling frame. 408 responses were collected from 200 software intensive organizations in the study. The survey included questions for identifying the rate of agile and lean usage in software organizations as well as the implementation of specific methods and practices, goals in adopting agile and lean, reasons for not applying these methods and effects of the agile and lean usage. The results of the survey reveal that a majority of respondents' organizational units are using agile and/or lean methods (58%). Furthermore, lean appears as a new player, being used by 24% of respondents, mainly in combination with agile (21%). The reasons and benefits for using agile and lean methods appeared to correspond in most parts to the findings of the earlier research. Generally, the experiences of using agile and lean methods seem to be rather positive, although challenges, such as obtaining management support and limitations for scaling agile in distributed settings, were also identified.","","","10.1145/2372251.2372275","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2372251.2372275","","Software development process management","","","","59","1,556","","","","","",""

We have performed a Systematic literature review (SLR) to collect relevant studies and a thematic analysis to synthesize the extracted data. We found 28 primary studies reporting the impact of five dispersion dimensions on team performance. Previously, only two primary studies considered and distinguished all of these dispersion dimensions in studying dispersed team performance. The dispersion dimensions affect team outcomes indirectly through influencing organic and mechanistic coordination processes. Empirical evidence show that geographical dispersion impacts negatively and temporal dispersion has a mixed effect on team performance. While studies with teams working across different time zones shows a tendency that the team performance is pessimistically perceived, studies that use direct measure on task performance shows a positive association to temporal dispersion. The paper provides implications for future research and practitioners in establishing effective distributed team coordination.","","","10.1145/2372251.2372274","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2372251.2372274","","Software configuration management and version control systems","","","","8","549","","","","","",""

The metrics were compared with each other and with the outcome of a study in which six developers were hired to perform three maintenance tasks on the same systems. Results: The metrics were not mutually consistent. Only system size and low cohesion were strongly associated with increased maintenance effort. Conclusion: Apart from size, surrogate maintainability measures may not reflect future maintenance effort. Surrogates need to be evaluated in the contexts for which they will be used. While traditional metrics are used to identify problematic areas in the code, the improvements of the worst areas may, inadvertently, lead to more problems for the entire system.

The other handing method, the interaction and the hierarchical linear model (HLM), might be able to compensate for them. However, the two methods have not been examined in the research area. Aim: giving useful suggestions for handling categorical variables with the stratification, transforming dummy variables, the interaction, or HLM, when building an estimation model. Method: We built estimation models with the four handling methods on ISBSG, NASA, and Desharnais datasets, and compared accuracy of the methods with each other. Results: The most effective method was different for datasets, and the difference was statistically significant on both mean balanced relative error (MBRE) and mean magnitude of relative error (MMRE). The interaction and HLM were effective in a certain case. Conclusions: The stratification and transforming dummy variables should be tried at least, for obtaining an accurate model.

We report on a study of risk perceptions for developers and acquirers in OTS-based custom software development projects. The study used an online questionnaire-based survey. We compared stakeholders' perceptions about their level of control over and exposure to 11 shared risks in OTS-based software, in 35 OTS-based software developments and 34 OTS-based software acquisitions of Indonesian background.

In addition, both stakeholders agree that the acquirer is most impacted by the risk of reduced control of future evolution of the system. We also found disagreement about who is most impacted by the risk of lack of support (usually each stakeholder reported themselves). This paper makes two main contributions.

These data include the code and how it was changed over time, and information about the changes from version control systems. Each of these can be considered at different levels of granularity. The level of granularity can substantially influence the estimated fault-proneness of a code artifact. Typically, the level of detail oscillates between releases and commits on the one hand, and single lines of code and whole files on the other hand. Not every information may be readily available or feasible to collect at every level, though, nor does more detail necessarily improve the results. Our approach is based on time series of changes in method-level dependencies and churn on a commit-to-commit basis for two systems, Spring and Eclipse. We identify sets of classes with distinct properties of the time series of their change histories. We differentiate between classes based on temporal patterns of change. Based on this differentiation, we show that our measure of structural change in concert with its complement, churn, effectively indicates fault-proneness in classes.

Using this approach, it is possible to capture and analyze software development practices. Our aims are to illustrate the use of an ethnographic approach in a case study of agile software development adoption, to discuss the methodological challenges involved, and to provide support to others who conduct ethnographic studies of software practice. An ethnographic case study was conducted, employing participant observation, interviews, and document analysis. Difficulties and decisions were recorded and compared with those encountered in the literature. Finally, key challenges and guidelines to tackle them were discussed and documented. We identified five key challenges of applying ethnography to the study of software practices: (a) working in collaboration with and having something to offer to the participating company; (b) the insider/outsider dynamic of participant observation; (c) the balance between participant listening and participant observation; (d) the researcher's relationship with the participants; and (e) the rigor in qualitative work that involves the dilemma of the contextualization to be sufficiently broad and detailed. This study shows that ethnographic methods are indispensible when trying to understand software practice, and that the fundamental challenge for the researcher is to balance the role of participant observer with rigorous fieldwork.","","","10.1145/2372251.2372255","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2372251.2372255","","Process validation","","","","15","451","","","","","",""

Typically, the solution is to incorporate this constraint into the design of the gameplay, but there are also other options to solve this disconnect issue. The FeelTact project proposes an innovative approach that does not use the screen as the primary output device. Instead, it concentrates on maximizing rich tactile feedback, as opposed to the more common vibrations already seen in other gaming devices. The FeelTact device is a new type of tactile bracelet that will drive the information a player receives. The first FeelTact game is an audiotactile mobile game based on an urban navigation system.

We focused on a systematic arrangement of viewpoints specialized to depict an exaggerated rendering of a figure model with articulated joints so that these viewpoints represent exaggerations similar to traditional freehand drawing in anime. For this purpose, we constructed a tree structure we call viewpoint hierarchy (VH), which is isomorphic to joint hierarchy, with nodes containing the viewpoints necessary for multiple perspectives.

SilverPromenade allows players to go on virtual walks while accounting for special needs regarding game complexity, and simplistic interaction paradigms are provided using Nintendo's Wii Remote and the Balance Board for game control. Evaluation results suggest that despite age-related impairments, the game was generally accessible to elderly persons. Yet, differences between inexperienced and experienced players were observed which suggest that interaction problems may be reduced by engaging with games over a longer time. Findings also indicate that the engagement of elderly players transcends into their everyday life, and their social interaction increases among one another. Most importantly, the evaluation showed that games were perceived as enjoyable leisure activity, supporting the approach of applying digital games to raise the quality of life among frail elderly by fostering activity.","","","10.1145/2071423.2071501","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2071423.2071501","","Interactive games","","","","55","1,266","","","","","",""

We design the receiving unit for the proposed sound-power visualization system named the Visualization System for Interaction with Transmitted Audio signals (VITA). In the VITA, 144 LEDs, which react to the sound emanating from a parametric loudspeaker, are arranged in a given space; this arrangement is used to provide a visual feedback to indicate the path of the sound. The feedback helps a user to manipulate the sound easily and directly and enables an interaction to be established between the user and the acoustical environment. With our proposed receiving unit, not all the LEDs need to be wired individually. We develop a system to visualize the sound field created in space and evaluate the established interaction and the performance of the sound-to-power transformation through demonstration and experiments. We also present a detailed evaluation of two circuits of the receiving unit that are used to turn on the LEDs and make the sound path visible up to a distance of 5 meters.

However, as the novelty will eventually vanish, what matters is the user experience related to the unique features offered by BCI. Therefore it is a viable approach to compare BCI to other novel modalities, such as a speech or motion recogniser, rather than the traditional mouse and keyboard. In the study which we present in this paper, our participants played a computer game with a BCI and an automatic speech recogniser (ASR) and they rated their expectations and experiences for both modalities. Our analysis on subjective ratings revealed that both ASR and BCI were successful in satisfying participants' expectations in general.

The study is motivated by the Pervasive GameFlow model and its involvement component. The main research question is whether aspects of involvement in desktop computer games are also valid for the immersion and enjoyment of players of pervasive games. In order to address this question, two empirical studies were performed: the first explored the possible correlations between several aspects of involvement and the enjoyment and immersion of players. The second compared two versions of an outdoor game, one with and the other without digital augmentations, in order to explore which version provided a higher degree of involvement and enjoyment. The results of these studies suggest that becoming less aware of everyday life is not a relevant aspect of the immersion and enjoyment of players of pervasive games and that there is no significant difference in these elements of the gaming experience (immersion and enjoyment) when comparing the digitally and non-digitally augmented versions of the outdoor game. These results suggest that the involvement experienced by players of pervasive games is not characterised by a sense of being transported into the virtual world of the game; instead, in these types of games the virtual world of the digital application is the one which is drawn out into the physical world.

Meanwhile, the increasing availability of valuable metadata resources has opened up the perspective for the automatic creation of such 3D environments by integrating semantic data sources through the Web. In this work we therefore present a prototype that automatically constructs a 3D environment from semantic art history related Web resources, offering users the opportunity to explore art history following the visualized structure of relations between historical actors of the field. Traversing this historical social network enables users to encounter previously unknown artists and their work in a serendipitous way.","","","10.1145/2071423.2071480","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2071423.2071480","","Graphical user interfaces","","","","2","158","","","","","",""

In this paper, we present a study in which 36 novice inspectors were divided into two identical groups, and they evaluated a mobile game using one of the two playability heuristic sets. In the second task, the inspectors analyzed playability problems that were collected from the game, and assigned heuristics to describe the problems.

However, output technology, in particular haptic feedback, is not as advanced as input technology. We believe that providing a haptic sensation enriches the content of musical video games since the results of the motion input are fed back. To enrich the haptic sensation, we propose a system for playing virtual chromatic percussion, where the haptic feedback changes according to the instrument, as well as the acoustic feedback. In this paper, we propose a system describing a novel stick type controller and pseudo-haptic feedback to enrich the haptic sensation of the content.

This framework, currently under development, captures which content provided the context for a given personal gameplay experience. This model is then used to generate content for the next predicted experience, through retrieval and recombination of semantic gameplay descriptions, i.e. case-based mappings between content and player experience. Through its integration with existing player and experience modeling techniques, this framework aims at generating, in an emergent way, game worlds that better suit players.

We believe the Snail Light Projector can be an innovative entertainment system, achieving interaction by using hyper-slow speed light, which enables the user to experience virtual physical phenomena directly.","","","10.1145/1971630.1971668","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1971630.1971668","","Virtual reality","","","","2","101","","","","","",""

Digital games can be applied in health care helping users to learn or to experience something in a fun way. However, there are important issues to be considered to achieve this goal, specially in the development of applications for people with special needs. In this work, we are concerned specifically with Down syndrome needs, and we present an unhackneyed game for children with Down syndrome between 3 to 7 years old. Children in pre-scholar age need to be stimulated considering different cognitive areas. The stimulation of such cognitive areas can provide good results in the development over the years. Given the current demand and absence of games that fulfill Down syndrome special needs, we developed JECRIPE. JECRIPE is a digital game that stimulates the specific cognitive abilities: imitation, perception, fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination and receptive and expressive verbal language. This paper describes how these cognitive areas are used to stimulate children with Down syndrome in pre-scholar age and some technical issues in the development of the game.","","","10.1145/1971630.1971635","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1971630.1971635","","Algorithmic game theory and mechanism design","","","","11","330","","","","","",""

Therefore, there is a need to assess the usability of those generated user interfaces, either taken in isolation or compared to each other. This paper describes an MDE approach that generates multi-platform graphical user interfaces (e.g., desktop, web) that will be subject to an exploratory controlled experiment. The usability of user interfaces generated for the two mentioned platforms and used on multiple display devices (i.e., standard size, large, and small screens) has been examined in terms of satisfaction, effectiveness and efficiency. An experiment with a factorial design for repeated measures was conducted for 31 participants, i.e., postgraduate students and professors selected by convenience sampling. The data were collected with the help of questionnaires and forms and were analyzed using parametric and non-parametric tests such as ANOVA with repeated measures and Friedman's test, respectively. Efficiency was significantly better in large screens than in small ones as well as in the desktop platform rather than in the web platform, with a confidence level of 95%. The experiment also suggests that satisfaction tends to be better in standard size screens than in small ones. The results suggest that the tested MDE approach should incorporate enhancements in its multi-device/platform user interface generation process in order to improve its generated usability.","","","10.1145/1852786.1852826","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1852786.1852826","","Program verification","","","","25","547","","","","","",""

In particular, many Scratch programs revealed significant technical mastery of the programming environment by programmers, and some animations even demonstrated design patterns. On the other hand, while the Scratch repository has successfully served as a supportive environment for generating constructive feedback among users, we did not find any occasions within our sample where this interaction led to online collaboration. In addition, we found low levels of code reuse, in terms of both frequency and success.

Two constraint specification techniques have been implemented in a meta-CASE tool a wizard that represents a conventional form-filling technique and an SBE technique that depends on the user providing one or more examples and the system inferring a list of possible intended constraints. The empirical study compared the wizard and SBE with respect to constraint definition correctness, task completion time, and user satisfaction. Two common modelling diagrams have been used, a State Transition Diagram and a Use Case Diagram. Results suggest that SBE is superior to the wizard in terms of measured criteria described above.

For example, one may expect that the combination of autonomous teams and the necessity for an overall organizational control structure may lead to conflicts, and one may expect that Agile's informal means of knowledge sharing breaks down as the number of project participants increases. Such issues may in turn compromise the project's productivity. In order to better understand potential threats to productivity in large agile development projects, we conducted repertory grid interviews with 13 project members on their perceptions of threats to productivity. The project was a large software development project consisting of 11 Scrum teams from three different subcontractors. The repertory grid sessions produced 100 issues, which were content analyzed into 10 main problem areas: (1) Restraints on collaboration due to contracts, ownership, and culture, (2) Architectural and technical qualities are given low priority, (3) Conflicts between organizational control and flexibility, (4) Volatile and late requirements from external parties, (5) Lack of a shared vision for the end product, (6) Limited dissemination of functional knowledge, (7) Excessive dependencies within the system, (8) Overloading of key personnel, (9) Difficulties in maintaining well-functioning technical environments, (10) Difficulties in coordinating test and deployment with external parties. Using critical-case reasoning, we claim that projects deploying agile practices in projects with less favorable conditions than those enjoyed in the current project, and that are larger and more complex, are likely to face similar challenges.","","","10.1145/1852786.1852806","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1852786.1852806","","Software development process management","","","","17","948","","","","","",""

However, the iterative nature of Scrum resulted in constant system and acceptance testing and related defect fixing, which made the development process more efficient in terms of fewer surprises and better control of software quality and release date. In addition, software quality and knowledge sharing got more focus when using Scrum. However, Scrum put more stress and time pressure on the developers, and made them reluctant to perform certain tasks for later maintenance, such as refactoring.","","","10.1145/1852786.1852804","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1852786.1852804","","Software development process management","","","","29","1,834","","","","","",""

The survey was conducted online from August--September 2009, and aims to identify where improvements to scientific software practices can be made. While our results generally confirm previous work, we have found some notable differences. The use of IDEs and version control tools among the surveyed scientific software developers has increased, and trace-ability of scientific software is not as important to scientific software developers as it is to scientific software users.

Our findings indicated that the basic approaches to test case selection are usually oriented towards two possible objectives. One is the risk-based selection, where the aim is to focus testing on those parts that are too expensive to fix after launch. The other is design-based selection, where the focus is on ensuring that the software is capable of completing the core operations it was designed to do. These results can then be used to develop testing organizations and to identify better practices for test case selection.","","","10.1145/1852786.1852800","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1852786.1852800","","Process validation","","","","9","729","","","","","",""

The study investigates the way professional software developers detect god class code smells, then compares these results to automatic classification. The results show that, even though the subjects perceive detecting god classes as an easy task, the agreement for the classification is low. Misplaced methods are a strong driver for letting subjects identify god classes as such. Earlier proposed metric-based detection approaches performed well compared to the human classification. These results lead to the conclusion that an automated metric-based pre-selection decreases the effort spent on manual code inspections. Automatic detection accompanied by a manual review increases the overall confidence in the results of metric-based classifiers.","","","10.1145/1852786.1852797","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1852786.1852797","","Metrics","","","","46","1,141","","","","","",""

Modular grime is observed when increases in the coupling of design pattern classes occur in ways unintended by the original designer. Further research is necessary to formally categorize distinct forms of modular grime. We identify three properties of coupling relationships that are used to classify subsets of modular grime. A taxonomy is presented which uses these properties to group modular grime into six disjoint categories. Illustrative examples of grime build-up are provided to demonstrate the taxonomy.

In this case, the ordering of test cases based on coverage information might not be effective. In this paper, we introduce a new test case prioritization technique that considers both coverage and historical fault information by incorporating fault localization technique. Using the historical fault detection information of test cases, our approach adjusts the priorities of fault-found test cases while maintaining test cases with high coverage in high priority. Our approach can reduce the total cost of executing entire test suite(s) and enables to detect faults earlier in a testing process by improving the testing effectiveness compared to the prior coverage-based techniques.","","","10.1145/1852786.1852793","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1852786.1852793","","Software testing and debugging","","","","9","551","","","","","",""

In this paper, we use a statistical approach recently proposed by Cataldo et al. to create explainable regression models. A case study on the Eclipse open source project shows that only 4 out of the 34 code and process metrics impacts the likelihood of finding a post-release defect. In addition, our approach is able to quantify the impact of these metrics on the likelihood of finding post-release defects.

Aims: The aims of the study were to confirm the usability of a quality evaluation checklist, determine how many reviewers were needed per paper that reports an experiment, and specify an appropriate process for evaluating quality. Method: With eight reviewers and four papers describing human-centric software engineering experiments, we used a quality checklist with nine questions. We conducted the study in two parts: the first was based on individual assessments and the second on collaborative evaluations. Results: The inter-rater reliability was poor for individual assessments but much better for joint evaluations. Four reviewers working in two pairs with discussion were more reliable than eight reviewers with no discussion. The sum of the nine criteria was more reliable than individual questions or a simple overall assessment. Conclusions: If quality evaluation is critical, more than two reviewers are required and a round of discussion is necessary. We advise using quality criteria and basing the final assessment on the sum of the aggregated criteria.

In this paper, we continue to investigate the security implications of a generic selective encryption procedure. That is, how entropy and guesswork changes with the number of encrypted units, i.e., the encryption level. This is done for languages up to the second order by deriving equations for entropy of selectively encrypted messages and then transferring the result to guesswork through an equation relating the two measures. Furthermore, unlike entropy, guesswork does not possess the chain rule, however, through the equation relating entropy and guesswork an equation connecting the different guessworks is derived.","","","10.1145/1853919.1853931","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1853919.1853931","","Computer crime","","","","4","163","","","","","",""

In choosing a variant or combination of variants, security demands need to be balanced against runtime overhead. Our study indicates that a good combination of variations when running two variants is to choose one of instruction set randomization, system call number randomization, and register randomization, and use that together with library entry point randomization.
