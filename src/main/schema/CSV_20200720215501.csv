We focused on the intersection of muscle fibers of surface layer muscle and deep layer muscle. On such a place, we found that we could measure independent muscle activity along each muscle fiber. In this result, we could confirm that we could measure surface layer muscle activity independently by comparing with the signal which is measured on extended line of surface muscle fiber and on outside of the deep layer muscle. Additionally, we identified propagation direction of EMG signal using electrode array. It was determined from delay time of EMG signal measured on each electrode. When we activated surface and deep layer muscle independently, each propagation direction of EMG signal corresponded to each muscle fiber direction.

The unconventional paradigm shift needed is justified by showing that conventional, minimalism-based, FSM synthesis and encodings allow direct correlation between state/transitions and Hamming Models. A two-fold method, involving structural modifications and specific encoding strategies, is proposed for side-channel secure FSM (S*FSMs).

In order to protect against these attacks, designers must incorporate complex countermeasures into the implementation of sensitive operations. Validating the effectiveness of implementation attack countermeasures requires specialized expertise and techniques not commonly used in other types of security and functional testing. We propose a modular testing environment for use in verifying the implementation attack resistance of secure systems. The proposed environment is an open-source solution that allows implementation attack testing to be independent of the system platform, implementation details, and type of attack under evaluation. These key features make the environment suitable for use with an implementation attack security standard in which standard test procedures are published openly and used to evaluate cryptographic systems. We use the proposed test environment to demonstrate a successful side-channel attack on AES, which illustrates the practical usefulness of our design for analyzing implementation attack security.

Each probe has a corresponding perfect match (PM) and mismatch (MM) set. Traditional analytical techniques have either used the MM probes to determine the level of cross-hybridization or reliability of the PM probe, or have been completely ignored. Given the availability of reference genome sequences, we have reanalyzed the mapping of both PM and MM probes to reference genomes in transcript regions. Our results suggest that depending of the species of interest, 66%-93% of the PM probes can be used reliably in terms of single unique matches to the genome, while a small number of the MM probes (typically less than 1%) could be incorporated into the analysis. In addition, we have examined the mapping of PM and MM probes to five different human genome projects, resulting in approximately a 70% overlap of uniquely mapping PM probes, and a subset of 51 uniquely mapping MM probes commonly found in all five projects, 24 of which are found within annotated exonic regions. These results suggest that individual variation in transcriptome regions provides an additional complexity to micro array data analysis.

However, a significant challenge within the community is in the development of approaches that can be used to rigorously verify and validate these models. In this paper, we present an approach to quantify and verify the behavioral properties of compartmental epidemiological models under several common modeling scenarios including: birth/death rates and multi-host/pathogen species. We build a workflow that uses metamorphic testing, novel visualization tools and model checking to gain insights into the functionality of compartmental epidemiological models. Our initial results indicate that metamorphic testing can be used to verify the implementation of these models and provide insights into special conditions where these mathematical models may fail. The visualization front-end allows the end-user to scan through a variety of parameters commonly used in these models to elucidate the conditions under which an epidemic can occur. Furthermore, specifying these models using a process algebra allows one to automatically construct behavioral properties that can be rigorously verified using model checking. Together, our approach allows for detecting implementation errors as well as handling conditions under which compartmental epidemiological models may fail to provide insights into disease spread dynamics.","","","10.1109/BioMedCom.2012.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6516431","","","data analysis;data visualisation;diseases;epidemics;formal verification;medical computing;process algebra;program testing","disease spread mechanism model;disease control;behavioral properties;compartmental epidemiological model;birth-death rate;multihost species;pathogen species;metamorphic testing;visualization tools;model checking;mathematical models;process algebra;disease spread dynamics;visual analytics","","10","110","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although such predictions are of fundamental importance in preventing the next global pandemic, there is a significant gap in trusting the outcomes/predictions solely based on such models. Hence, there is a need to develop approaches such that mathematical models can be calibrated against historical data. In addition, there is a need to develop rigorous uncertainty quantification approaches that can provide insights into when a model will fail and characterize the confidence in the (possibly multiple) model outcomes/predictions, when such retrospective analysis cannot be performed. In this paper, we outline an approach to develop uncertainty quantification approaches for epidemiological models using formal methods and model checking. By specifying the outcomes expected from a model in a suitable spatio-temporal logic, we use probabilistic model checking methods to quantify the probability with which the epidemiological model satisfies a given behavioral specification.

One of the ways to cope with it is called policy comparison. In this paper we develop and use our approach to perform policy comparison, i.e. when newly specified access control policies for the resources are provided to be compared with certain original policy, we are able to ensure that the noncompliance problem between these newly specified policies and the original policies on the resources will be found. In this paper we propose the READ (Resolution and Abduction based) algorithm to be an approach of finding policy noncompliance. Our approach is based on the resolution and abduction work for Data log rules, and the evaluation of compliance is performed through set implication by Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) Z3 prover. We will illustrate the implementation of READ algorithm with two examples from existing work and one example based on role based access control model.","","","10.1109/BioMedCom.2012.24","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6516437","access control;collaboration;policy comparison;resolution;abduction","","authorisation;computability;DATALOG","READ algorithm;resolution and abduction based approach;policy comparison;organizational collaboration;policy compliance problem;inconsistency problem;access control policy;policy noncompliance problem;Datalog rules;compliance evaluation;satisfiability modulo theories;SMT Z3 prover;role based access control model","","0","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even if security is considered early, this means that in most cases a more-or-less encompassing security requirement analyses is made; Based on this analysis best-practices, ad-hoc design decisions or individual expertise is used to integrate security during the development process or after weaknesses are found after the deployment. This paper introduces Security Building Block Models which are used to build security related components, namely Security Building Blocks. These Security Building Blocks represent concrete security solutions, so called Security Properties, introduced in other publications of the SecFutur project [1]. The goal of this approach is to provide already defined and tested security related software components, which can be used early in the overall development process, to support security-design-decision already while modeling the software-system. The paper shortly describes this new Security Engineering Process with its requirement analysis and definition of Security Properties and how the Security Building Block Model fits into this approach. Additionally the Security Building Block Model is presented in detail. All artifacts and relationships of the model are described. Short examples finish up the paper to show the creation of the Security Building Blocks and their interactions with other software components.","","","10.1109/BioMedCom.2012.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6516441","security engineering;security models and meta-models;security building blocks;integration of components component;modelling","","decision making;formal verification;program testing;security of data","security building block models;software development process;security related design decisions;security requirement analyses;ad-hoc design decisions;individual expertise;security properties;SecFutur project;tested security related software components;software system modeling;security engineering process","","1","494","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With globalization, human groups tend to interact with other groups that can have one or multiple types of viruses. Currently, there are many mathematical models for studying patterns of emerging infectious diseases. These mathematical models are based on differential equations and can become unmanageable due to many parameters involved. With this in mind, we design and implement a simple spatial computational multi-agent model that can be used as a tool to analyze and predict the behavior of emerging infectious diseases. Our novel computational agent-based model integrated with evolution and phylogeny to simulate and understand emerging infectious diseases, which enables us to prevent or control outbreaks of infectious diseases in an effective and timely manner. Our multi-agent spatial-temporal model contributes to epidemiology, public health and computational simulation in several folds: First, our simulation offers an effective way to train public policy decision-makers who will respond to emergent outbreaks of infectious diseases in an appropriately and timely manner. Second, our model has the potential to aid real-time disease control and decision making. Third, our model uniquely takes evolution of viruses into account. Evolution of viruses means their genomic DNA/RNA sequence can mutate and compete for subpopulations of hosts (human, birds/pets). Our implementation provides graphical representation of the results by conducting a set of experiments under various settings.","","","10.1109/BioMedCom.2012.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6516424","multi-agent systems;modeling","Viruses (medical);Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Unified modeling language;Infectious diseases;Multi-agent systems","decision making;differential equations;diseases;DNA;medical computing;microorganisms;multi-agent systems;RNA","infectious disease;vector-borne disease;globalization;virus;mathematical model;differential equation;spatial computational multiagent model;phylogeny;epidemiology;public health;computational simulation;disease control;decision making;genomic DNA-RNA sequence","","0","224","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A common algorithmic strategy is to construct the program state space on-the-fly and perform thread scheduling choices at any instruction that could have effects visible to other threads. Existing tools do not look ahead in the code to be executed, and thus their decisions are too conservative. They create unnecessary thread scheduling choices at instructions that do not actually influence other threads, which implies exploring exponentially greater numbers of interleavings. In this paper we describe how information about field accesses that may occur in the future can be used to identify and eliminate unnecessary thread choices. This reduces the number of states that must be processed to explore all possible behaviors and therefore improves the performance of exhaustive state space traversal. We have applied this technique to Java PathFinder, using the WALA library for static analysis. Experiments on several Java programs show big performance gains. In particular, it is now possible to check with Java PathFinder more complex programs than before in reasonable time.","","","10.1109/ASE.2011.6100154","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ASE.2011.6100154","","Program semantics","","","","6","71","","","","","",""

If faults are detected, a fault localization algorithm can be used to reduce the manual inspection cost. However, while using test case prioritization to enhance the rate of fault detection of the test suite (e.g., statement coverage), the diagnostic information gain per test is not optimal, which results in needless inspection cost during diagnosis. We present RAPTOR, a test prioritization algorithm for fault localization, based on reducing the similarity between statement execution patterns as the testing progresses. Unlike previous diagnostic prioritization algorithms, RAPTOR does not require false negative information, and is much less complex. Experimental results from the Software Infrastructure Repository's benchmarks show that RAPTOR is the best technique under realistic conditions, with average cost reductions of 40% with respect to the next best technique, with negligible impact on fault detection capability.","","","10.1109/ASE.2011.6100153","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ASE.2011.6100153","","Software testing and debugging","","","","12","177","","","","","",""

Achieving high code coverage of the database application is important in testing. In practice, there may exist a copy of live databases that can be used for database application testing. Using an existing database state is desirable since it tends to be representative of real-world objects' characteristics, helping detect faults that could cause failures in real-world settings. However, to cover a specific program code portion (e.g., block), appropriate program inputs also need to be generated for the given existing database state. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel approach that generates program inputs for achieving high code coverage of a database application, given an existing database state. Our approach uses symbolic execution to track how program inputs are transformed before appearing in the executed SQL queries and how the constraints on query results affect the application's execution. One significant challenge in our problem context is the gap between program-input constraints derived from the program and from the given existing database state; satisfying both types of constraints is needed to cover a specific program code portion. Our approach includes novel query formulation to bridge this gap. Our approach is loosely integrated into Pex, a state-of-the-art white-box testing tool for .NET from Microsoft Research. Empirical evaluations on two real database applications show that our approach assists Pex to generate program inputs that achieve higher code coverage than the program inputs generated by Pex without our approach's assistance.","","","10.1109/ASE.2011.6100152","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ASE.2011.6100152","","Software testing and debugging","","","","18","157","","","","","",""
