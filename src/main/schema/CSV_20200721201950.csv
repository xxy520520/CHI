"Identifying future field accesses in exhaustive state space traversal","Pavel Parizek; Pavel Parizek; Ondrej Lhotak","David R.

A common algorithmic strategy is to construct the program state space on-the-fly and perform thread scheduling choices at any instruction that could have effects visible to other threads. Existing tools do not look ahead in the code to be executed, and thus their decisions are too conservative. They create unnecessary thread scheduling choices at instructions that do not actually influence other threads, which implies exploring exponentially greater numbers of interleavings. In this paper we describe how information about field accesses that may occur in the future can be used to identify and eliminate unnecessary thread choices. This reduces the number of states that must be processed to explore all possible behaviors and therefore improves the performance of exhaustive state space traversal. We have applied this technique to Java PathFinder, using the WALA library for static analysis. Experiments on several Java programs show big performance gains. In particular, it is now possible to check with Java PathFinder more complex programs than before in reasonable time.","","","10.1109/ASE.2011.6100154","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ASE.2011.6100154","","Program semantics","","","","6","71","","","","","",""

If faults are detected, a fault localization algorithm can be used to reduce the manual inspection cost. However, while using test case prioritization to enhance the rate of fault detection of the test suite (e.g., statement coverage), the diagnostic information gain per test is not optimal, which results in needless inspection cost during diagnosis. We present RAPTOR, a test prioritization algorithm for fault localization, based on reducing the similarity between statement execution patterns as the testing progresses. Unlike previous diagnostic prioritization algorithms, RAPTOR does not require false negative information, and is much less complex. Experimental results from the Software Infrastructure Repository's benchmarks show that RAPTOR is the best technique under realistic conditions, with average cost reductions of 40% with respect to the next best technique, with negligible impact on fault detection capability.","","","10.1109/ASE.2011.6100153","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ASE.2011.6100153","","Software testing and debugging","","","","12","177","","","","","",""

Achieving high code coverage of the database application is important in testing. In practice, there may exist a copy of live databases that can be used for database application testing. Using an existing database state is desirable since it tends to be representative of real-world objects' characteristics, helping detect faults that could cause failures in real-world settings. However, to cover a specific program code portion (e.g., block), appropriate program inputs also need to be generated for the given existing database state. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel approach that generates program inputs for achieving high code coverage of a database application, given an existing database state. Our approach uses symbolic execution to track how program inputs are transformed before appearing in the executed SQL queries and how the constraints on query results affect the application's execution. One significant challenge in our problem context is the gap between program-input constraints derived from the program and from the given existing database state; satisfying both types of constraints is needed to cover a specific program code portion. Our approach includes novel query formulation to bridge this gap. Our approach is loosely integrated into Pex, a state-of-the-art white-box testing tool for .NET from Microsoft Research. Empirical evaluations on two real database applications show that our approach assists Pex to generate program inputs that achieve higher code coverage than the program inputs generated by Pex without our approach's assistance.","","","10.1109/ASE.2011.6100152","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ASE.2011.6100152","","Software testing and debugging","","","","18","157","","","","","",""

The cost of repairing the errors that are due to mistakes in models is very high. In this research, we address this problem by developing model checking techniques that can be applied to abstract models that guide designers throughout the evolution of models and systems. Abstract models are declarative, expressed as a set of constraints, and this declarative aspect is the main challenge in model checking them. Our main idea for solving this problem is to express the model checking problem as a constraint solving problem. This approach enables designers to use current state-of-the-art constraint solvers for analysis. We have implemented this idea for Alloy models and we are further extending it for automatic model repairing. To achieve scalability, we have developed BDD-based methods for analysis of declarative models and we are studying model checking methods that are based on satisfiability modulo theories. We plan to extend these methods to infinite state space models.","","","10.1109/ASE.2011.6100149","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ASE.2011.6100149","","Program verification","","","","0","64","","","","","",""

Non-functional requirements like scalability increase this complexity further. In this paper, I show how one can bootstrap requirements using data captured from initial prototypes deployed in small scale real world tests. Using such captures as seeds, I show how a calculus of transformations on captures, from captures to scenarios, among scenarios, and from scenarios back to captures can be used in several requirements engineering tasks.

Moreover, many tools show the program changes at the text line level. In this demo, we present iDiff, a program differencing tool that is able to display the changes to classes/methods between two versions and to track the corresponding classes/methods even they were reordered/moved/renamed and/or modified. The key idea is that during software evolution, an entity could change its location, name, order, and even its internal implementation. However, its interaction with other entities would be more stable. iDiff represents a system at a version as an attributed graph, in which the nodes represent program entities, the edges represent the interactions between the nodes. Entities between two versions are matched via an incremental matching algorithm, which takes into account the similarity of interactions for matching. The differences of two versions of the entire system including its program entities are detected based on the matched entities.","","","10.1109/ASE.2011.6100128","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ASE.2011.6100128","","","","","","2","100","","","","","",""

We envision a novel approach to facilitate the use of constraints: to provide a mixed notation for writing the properties. Our key insight is that different properties can lend to easier formulation using different programming paradigms. Thus, a notation that supports more than one paradigm, e.g., declarative and imperative paradigms, can enable achieving a sweet-spot in minimizing the manual effort required in constraint formulation. Moreover, solving such constraints is also likely to be more efficient as different properties may require different paradigms for more direct and accurate representation.

The effect of both issues is that companies need to be able to handle deviations during process enactment. In order to make sure that process agents follow the process model and that their deviations get detected and handled, they adopt the so-called Process-centered Software Engineering Environments (PSEEs). Unfortunately, the options proposed by these tools, when it comes to handling a deviation, are rather limited to basically ignoring or forbidding it.

To address this shortcoming, we introduce elastic predicates, a novel approach to predicate-based statistical debugging. Elastic predicates introduce profiling of values assigned to variables within a failing program. These elastic predicates are better predictors of software failure than the static and uniform predicates used in existing techniques such as Cooperative Bug Isolation (CBI).

To take advantage of the inherent parallelism in test suites, multiple resources are often deployed to test an application. The resource allocation is however driven more by costs and risks and does not exploit the parallelism. Test execution plans are often static in nature and are not well equipped to handle dynamically occurring events like abends, and changes in resource availability and test requirements. Derivation of test plans is a cumbersome activity, as it also needs to take into account test execution order, violation of which may result in unexpected failures. In this paper, we describe an approach to derive a test execution plan to facilitate parallel execution, given resource availability and test case dependencies. The execution plan provides workload distribution and scheduling of the test cases in a test suite. The case studies on test projects have shown that the derived test plans can contribute significantly towards improving the test execution cycles of the test suites.","","","10.1109/ASE.2011.6100106","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ASE.2011.6100106","","Software testing and debugging","","","","1","76","","","","","",""

However, to leverage models created using these tools for automated analysis, simulation, and code generation, end-users must build custom analysis tools and code generators. In contrast to model editors, the implementation and maintenance of these analysis and code generation tools can be tedious and hampers the utility of DSLs. In this paper, we posit that analysis and code generation tools for DSLs are, in fact, isomorphic to model editing tools.

AutoODC is a promising approach: not only does it leverage minimal human effort beyond the human annotations typically required by standard machine learning approaches, but it achieves an overall accuracy of 80.2% when using manual classifications as a basis of comparison.","","","10.1109/ASE.2011.6100086","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ASE.2011.6100086","","Classification and regression trees","","","","5","104","","","","","",""

In this work, we propose to mine test oracles of Web search engines from existing search results. The main idea is to mine implicit relationships between queries and search results, e.g., some queries may have fixed top 1 result while some may not, and some Web domains may appear together in top 10 results. We define a set of items of queries and search results, and mine frequent association rules between these items as test oracles. Experiments on major search engines show that our approach mines many high-confidence rules that help understand search engines and detect suspicious search results.","","","10.1109/ASE.2011.6100085","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ASE.2011.6100085","","Data mining","","","","3","79","","","","","",""

In this paper, we present a novel program-transformation technique called heap cloning. Heap cloning transforms a program in such a way that dynamic symbolic execution of the transformed program results in the same path constraints as dynamic symbolic execution of the original program. However, symbolic execution of the transformed program produces feedback on where imprecision is introduced, and that feedback can reduce the manual effort required to build models. Furthermore, such transformation can enable existing approaches to perform symbolic execution systems to overcome their limitations. In this paper, we also present a system, called Cinger, that leverages heap cloning, and that we used to perform an empirical evaluation.

However, in software forums, often there are many threads containing similar keywords where each thread could contain a lot of posts as many as 1,000 or more. Manually finding relevant answers from these long threads is a painstaking task to the users. Finding relevant answers is particularly hard in software forums as: complexities of software systems cause a huge variety of issues often expressed in similar technical jargons, and software forum users are often expert internet users who often posts answers in multiple venues creating many duplicate posts, often without satisfying answers, in the world wide web. To address this problem, this paper provides a semantic search engine framework to process software threads and recover relevant answers according to user queries. Different from standard information retrieval engine, our framework infer semantic tags of posts in the software forum threads and utilize these tags to recover relevant answer posts. In our case study, we analyze 6,068 posts from three software forums. In terms of accuracy of our inferred tags, we could achieve on average an overall precision, recall and F-measure of 67%, 71%, and 69% respectively.

Given a new bug report, developers must search through a large number of files in a project to locate buggy code. We propose BugScout, an automated approach to help developers reduce such efforts by narrowing the search space of buggy files when they are assigned to address a bug report. BugScout assumes that the textual contents of a bug report and that of its corresponding source code share some technical aspects of the system which can be used for locating buggy source files given a new bug report. We develop a specialized topic model that represents those technical aspects as topics in the textual contents of bug reports and source files, and correlates bug reports and corresponding buggy files via their shared topics. Our evaluation shows that BugScout can recommend buggy files correctly up to 45% of the cases with a recommended ranked list of 10 files.","","","10.1109/ASE.2011.6100062","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ASE.2011.6100062","","","","","","41","226","","","","","",""

Once finish using the resources, the software systems must release these resources by explicitly calling specific resource-releasing API methods. Failing to release resources properly could result in resource leaks or even outright system failures. Existing verification techniques could analyze software systems to detect defects related to failing to release resources. However, these techniques require resource-releasing specifications for specifying which API method acquires/releases certain resources, and such specifications are not well documented in practice, due to the large amount of manual effort required to document them. To address this issue, we propose an iterative mining approach, called RRFinder, to automatically mining resource-releasing specifications for API libraries in the form of (resource-acquiring, resource-releasing) API method pairs. RRFinder first identifies resource-releasing API methods, for which RRFinder then identifies the corresponding resource-acquiring API methods. To identify resource-releasing API methods, RRFinder performs an iterative process including three steps: model-based prediction, call-graph-based propagation, and class-hierarchy-based propagation. From heterogeneous information (e.g., source code, natural language), the model-based prediction employs a classification model to predict the likelihood that an API method is a resource-releasing method. The call-graph-based and class-hierarchy-based propagation propagates the likelihood information across methods. We evaluated RRFinder on eight open source libraries, and the results show that RRFinder achieved an average recall of 94.0% with precision of 86.6% in mining resource-releasing specifications, and the mined specifications are useful in detecting resource leak defects.","","","10.1109/ASE.2011.6100058","","https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1109/ASE.2011.6100058","","","","","","7","71","","","","","",""

Since exhaustive exploration of the design space is infeasible for large models, the traversal is often guided by hints, derived by system analysis, to prioritize the next states to traverse (selection criteria) and to avoid searching unpromising states (cut-off criteria).

This transformation of differences depends on the model type, supported editing operations, and user preferences; thus specific transformers are needed, and building them is a challenge.

We propose PhpSync, a novel automatic locating/fixing tool for HTML validation errors in PHP-based Web applications. Given an HTML page produced by a server-side PHP program, PhpSync uses Tidy, an HTML validating/correcting tool to find the validation errors in that HTML page. If errors are detected, it leverages the fixes from Tidy in the given HTML page and propagates them to the corresponding location(s) in PHP code.
